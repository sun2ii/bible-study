Psalm 8:3-5
  When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,
  The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;

  What is man that You take thought of him,
  And the son of man that You care for him?

  Yet You have made him a little lower than God,
  And You crown him with glory and majesty!
