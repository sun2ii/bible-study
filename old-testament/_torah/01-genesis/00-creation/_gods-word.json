God's Creation
-----------------------
God said, 
"Let there be light"; 

Then God said, 
"Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, 
and let it separate the waters from the waters." 

Then God said, 
"Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, 
and let the dry land appear"; 

Then God said, 
"Let the earth sprout vegetation, 
plants yielding seed, 
and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit 
after their kind with seed in them"; 

Then God said, 
"Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens 
to separate the day from the night, 
and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; 
and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens 
to give light on the earth"; 

Then God said, 
"Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, 
and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens." 

Then God said, 
"Let the earth bring forth 
living creatures after their kind: 
cattle and creeping things and 
beasts of the earth after their kind"; 

Then God said, 
"Let Us make man in Our image, 
according to Our likeness; 
and let them rule over the fish of the sea and 
over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, 
and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." 

Then God said, 
"Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed 
that is on the surface of all the earth, 
and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; 
it shall be food for you; 
and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and 
to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, 
I have given every green plant for food";

God's Blessings
-----------------------
God blessed them, saying, 
"Be fruitful and multiply, 
and fill the waters in the seas, 
and let birds multiply on the earth." 

God blessed them; and God said to them, 
"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; 
and rule over the fish of the sea and 
over the birds of the sky and over 
every living thing that moves on the earth."
