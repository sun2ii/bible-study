  Now he called his name Noah, saying, 
  "This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands arising from the ground which the LORD has cursed." 

  Then Lamech lived 595 after he became the father of Noah, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  So all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died. 
  Noah was 500 years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 

Genesis 6 
  Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, 
  that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; 
  and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. 

  Then the LORD said, 
  "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, 
  because he also is flesh; 
  nevertheless his days shall be 120 years." 

  The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, 
  when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. 
  Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. 
  Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 
  The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. 

  The LORD said, 
  "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, 
  from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; 
  for I am sorry that I have made them."

  But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. 
  These are the records of the generations of Noah. 
  Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God. 
  Noah became the father of 3 sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 

  Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
  God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. 

----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
  Then God said to Noah, 
  "The end of all flesh has come before Me; 
  for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, 
  I am about to destroy them with the earth. 

  Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; 
  you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch. 

  This is how you shall make it: 
  the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
  You shall make a window for the ark, and finish it to a cubit from the top; 
  and set the door of the ark in the side of it; 
  you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks. 

  Behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, 
  to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under heaven; 
  everything that is on the earth shall perish. 
  But I will establish My covenant with you; 
  and you shall enter the ark--you and your sons and your wife, and your sons' wives with you. 
  And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring 2 of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; 
  they shall be male and female. 

  Of the birds after their kind, and of the animals after their kind, 
  of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, 
  2 of every kind will come to you to keep them alive. 
  As for you, take for yourself some of all food which is edible, 
  and gather it to yourself; and it shall be for food for you and for them."

  Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did. 

Genesis 7

  Then the LORD said to Noah, 
  "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you alone I have seen to be righteous before Me in this time.
  You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; 
  and of the animals that are not clean 2, a male and his female; 
  also of the birds of the sky, by sevens, male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth. 
  For after 7 more days, I will send rain on the earth 40 days and 40 nights; 
  and I will blot out from the face of the land every living thing that I have made." 

  Noah did according to all that the LORD had commanded him. 
  Now Noah was 600 years old when the flood of water came upon the earth. 
  Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him entered the ark because of the water of the flood. 
  Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and everything that creeps on the ground, 
  there went into the ark to Noah by twos, male and female, as God had commanded Noah. 
  It came about after the 7 days, that the water of the flood came upon the earth. 
  In the 600 year of Noah's life, in the 2nd month, on the 17th day of the month, 
  on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, 
  and the floodgates of the sky were opened. 

  The rain fell upon the earth for 40 days and 40 nights. 
  On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, 
  the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the 3 wives of his sons with them, entered the ark, 

  they and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, 
  and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, 
  and every bird after its kind, all sorts of birds. 

  So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in which was the breath of life. 
  Those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed it behind him. 
  Then the flood came upon the earth for 40 days, and the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth. 
  
  The water prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, 
  and the ark floated on the surface of the water. 
  The water prevailed more and more upon the earth, 
  so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered. 
  The water prevailed 15 cubits higher, and the mountains were covered. 

  All flesh that moved on the earth perished, 
  birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; 
  of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. 
  
  Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, 
  from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, 
  and they were blotted out from the earth; 
  and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark. 
  
  The water prevailed upon the earth 150 days. 

Genesis 8 
----------------------------------------
02-noah/03-the-earth-dried-up.md
----------------------------------------
  But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; 
  and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided. 
  Also the fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained; 
  and the water receded steadily from the earth, and at the end of 150 days the water decreased. 

  In the 7th month, on the 17th day of the month, the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat. 
  The water decreased steadily until the 10th month; in the 10th month, on the 1st day of the month, 
  the tops of the mountains became visible. 

  Then it came about at the end of 40 days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made; 
  and he sent out a raven, and it flew here and there until the water was dried up from the earth. 
  Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the water was abated from the face of the land; 
  but the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, 
  so she returned to him into the ark, for the water was on the surface of all the earth. 
  Then he put out his hand and took her, and brought her into the ark to himself. 

  So he waited yet another 7 days; and again he sent out the dove from the ark. 
  The dove came to him toward evening, and behold, in her beak was a freshly picked olive leaf. 
  So Noah knew that the water was abated from the earth. 
  Then he waited yet another 7 days, and sent out the dove; but she did not return to him again. 

  Now it came about in the 601st year, in the 1st month, on the 1st of the month, the water was dried up from the earth. 
  Then Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dried up. 
  In the 2nd month, on the 27th day of the month, the earth was dry. 

  Then God spoke to Noah, saying, 
  "Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you. 
  Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, 
  birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, 
  that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth." 

  So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him. 
  Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark. 
  Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 

  The LORD smelled the soothing aroma; and the LORD said to Himself, 
  "I will never again curse the ground on account of man, 
  for the intent of man's heart is evil from his youth; 
  and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done. 
  While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, 
  And cold and heat, And summer and winter, And day and night Shall not cease." 

Genesis 9

  And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, 
  "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 
  The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; 
  with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given. 
  Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; 
  I give all to you, as I gave the green plant. 
  Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. 
  Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. 
  And from every man, from every man's brother I will require the life of man. 
  Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, 

  For in the image of God He made man. 
  As for you, be fruitful and multiply; 
  Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it." 

  Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 
  "Now behold, I Myself do establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you; 
  and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you;
   of all that comes out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. 
  I establish My covenant with you; and all flesh shall never again be cut off by the water of the flood, 
  neither shall there again be a flood to destroy the earth." 

  God said, 
  "This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, 
  for all successive generations; I set My bow in the cloud, 
  and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. 
  It shall come about, when I bring a cloud over the earth, 
  that the bow will be seen in the cloud, 
  and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; 
  and never again shall the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
  When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, 
  to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."

  And God said to Noah, 
  "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth."

  Now the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham was the father of Canaan. 
  These 3 were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated. 
  Then Noah began farming and planted a vineyard. 
  He drank of the wine and became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent. 
  Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his 2 brothers outside. 
  But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; 
  and their faces were turned away, so that they did not see their father's nakedness. 
  When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. 

  So he said, 
  "Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers." 

  He also said, 
  "Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; 
  And let Canaan be his servant. 
  May God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; 
  And let Canaan be his servant." 

  Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 
  So all the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died. 
  Now these are the records of the generations of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah; and sons were born to them after the flood. 
  The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras. 
  The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah. 
  The sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim. 
  From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. 
  The sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan. 
  The sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. 
  Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth. 
  He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD." 
  The beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
  From that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth
  and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. 
  Mizraim became the father of Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim 
  and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from which came the Philistines) and Caphtorim. 
  Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth 
  and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite 
  and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite 
  and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad. 
  The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
  These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, by their nations. 
  Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, and the older brother of Japheth, children were born. 
  The sons of Shem were Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram. 
  The sons of Aram were Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash. 
  Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber. 
  Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 
  Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah 
  and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah 
  and Obal and Abimael and Sheba 
  and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 
  Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east. 
  These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations. 
  These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, by their nations; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood. 

Genesis 11

  Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words. 
  It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 

  They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly." 
  And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. 

  They said, 
  "Come, let us build for ourselves a city,
  and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, 
  and let us make for ourselves a name, 
  otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth." 

  The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. The LORD said, 
  "Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. 
  And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them. 
  Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another's speech." 
  So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city. 
  Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth; 
  and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth. -- genesis 11:9

  These are the records of the generations of Shem. Shem was 100 years old, and became the father of Arpachshad 2 years after the flood; 
  and Shem lived 500 years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Arpachshad lived 35 years, and became the father of Shelah; 
  and Arpachshad lived 403 years after he became the father of Shelah, 
  and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Shelah lived 30 years, and became the father of Eber;
  and Shelah lived 403 years after he became the father of Eber, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Eber lived 34 years, and became the father of Peleg; 
  and Eber lived 430 years after he became the father of Peleg, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Peleg lived 30 years, and became the father of Reu; 
  and Peleg lived 209 years after he became the father of Reu, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Reu lived 32 years, and became the father of Serug; 
  and Reu lived 207 years after he became the father of Serug, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Serug lived 30 years, and became the father of Nahor; 
  and Serug lived 200 years after he became the father of Nahor, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Nahor lived 29 years, and became the father of Terah; 
  and Nahor lived 119 years after he became the father of Terah, and he had other sons and daughters. 
  Terah lived 70 years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. 
  Now these are the records of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran; and Haran became the father of Lot. 

  Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 
  Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. 
  Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
  Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter
  The days of Terah were 205 years; and Terah died in Haran.
