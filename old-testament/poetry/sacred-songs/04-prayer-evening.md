- 4. Evening Prayer
------------------------------------

Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!
You have relieved me in my distress;
Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.

O sons of men, how long will my honor become disapproved?
How long will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? 

But know that the Lord has set apart the godly man for Himself;
The Lord hears when I call to Him.

Tremble, and do not sin;
Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. 

Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
And trust in the Lord.

Many are saying, 'Who will show us any good?'

Lift up the light of Your facial expression upon us, O Lord!
You have put gladness in my heart,
More than when their grain and new wine abound.

In peace I will both lie down and sleep,
For You alone, O Lord, make me to dwell in safety.
