- 1. The Blessed vs The Wicked.
------------------------------------

Blessed is the man who 
  "Does not walk  in the counsel of the wicked
  Does not stand in the path    of sinners
  Does not sit   in the seat    of scoffers
  Delights in the law of the lord
  He meditates in the law day and night"

A Blessed man will be like 
  "A tree, firmly planted, by streams of water.
  Which yields its fruit in its season. And its leaf does not wither.
  In whatever he does, he prospers."

A Wicked man will be like
  'chaff (worthless things; trash) which the wind drives away'

Therefore, 
  'The wicked will not stand in the judgment
   Sinners    will not stand in the assembly of the righteous'

For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
But the way of the wicked perish.
