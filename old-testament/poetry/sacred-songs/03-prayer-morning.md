- 3. Morning Prayer
------------------------------------

O Lord, how my enemies have increased!
Many are rising up against me.
Many are saying of my soul, 'There is no deliverance for him in God.'

"You, O Lord, are a shield about me,
My glory, and the One who lifts my head.
I was crying to the Lord with my voice,
And He answered me from His holy mountain."

I lay down and slept;
I awoke, for the Lord sustains me.

I will not be afraid of 10,000 people
Who have set themselves against me.

Arise, O Lord; save me, My God!
For You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek;
You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.

Salvation belongs to the Lord;
Your blessing be upon Your people!
