## vv. 1-6: John the Baptist Appears

### The Flow

```
v. 1: JOHN ARRIVES
    │
    ├─ "In those days" ◄── ~30 years since chapter 2
    ├─ Location: Wilderness of Judea
    └─ Activity: Preaching
    │
v. 2: HIS MESSAGE
    │
    └─► "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near"
        │
        ├─ Repent (μετανοέω) = Change your mind/direction
        └─ Kingdom of heaven = Matthew's Jewish term for "kingdom of God"
    │
v. 3: PROPHECY FULFILLED (Isaiah 40:3)
    │
    └─► "A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
         'Prepare the way for the Lord,
         make straight paths for him.'"
    │
    John = The voice
    Lord = Jesus
    │
vv. 4-6: JOHN'S LIFE & IMPACT
    │
    ├─ Clothing: Camel's hair + leather belt ◄── Like Elijah (2 Kings 1:8)
    ├─ Food: Locusts + wild honey ◄── Wilderness provisions
    │
    └─► Response:
        ├─ Jerusalem
        ├─ All Judea          ──► Went out to him
        └─ Whole Jordan region
            │
            └─► Confessing sins → Baptized in Jordan
```

### John as the New Elijah

| Elijah (2 Kings 1:8) | John the Baptist |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Garment of hair | Camel's hair clothing |
| Leather belt | Leather belt |
| Wilderness prophet | Wilderness preacher |
| Confronted wicked king (Ahab) | Confronted religious leaders |
| Called Israel to repentance | Called Israel to repentance |

**Malachi 4:5** - "I will send the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the Lord."

### What is Repentance?

```
REPENTANCE (μετανοέω / metanoeō)
    │
    ├─ META = change, after
    └─ NOEŌ = mind, thinking
    │
    = "Change of mind" that leads to change of direction
    │
    NOT just feeling sorry
    NOT just behavior modification
    │
    = Complete reorientation toward God
```

### One-Line Cut
**400 years of prophetic silence broken by a wild man in camel hair, pointing Israel back to repentance.**

---

## vv. 7-10: Warning to the Religious Leaders

### The Flow

```
v. 7: PHARISEES & SADDUCEES ARRIVE
    │
    John sees them coming to be baptized
    │
    └─► "You brood of vipers!"
        │
        ├─ Snakes fleeing a fire ◄── Running from judgment
        └─ "Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
    │
v. 8: THE DEMAND
    │
    └─► "Produce fruit in keeping with repentance"
        │
        ├─ Real repentance = visible fruit
        └─ Baptism without heart change = meaningless ritual
    │
v. 9: THE FALSE SECURITY
    │
    └─► "Do not think you can say to yourselves,
         'We have Abraham as our father'"
        │
        ├─ Jewish assumption: Ancestry = salvation
        └─ John's counter: "God can raise up children from stones"
    │
v. 10: THE URGENCY
    │
    └─► "The ax is already at the root of the trees"
        │
        ├─ Not coming ──► Already there
        ├─ Not branches ──► Root (total destruction)
        └─ "Every tree that does not produce good fruit
            will be cut down and thrown into the fire"
```

### Pharisees vs. Sadducees

| Group | Beliefs | Social Status |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Pharisees** | Oral tradition + Scripture, resurrection, angels, strict law-keeping | Middle class, popular |
| **Sadducees** | Scripture only, NO resurrection, NO angels | Wealthy, priestly aristocracy |

**They were enemies theologically but united here - both exposed as fruitless.**

### The Fruit Test

```
CLAIM TO BE GOD'S PEOPLE
    │
    ├─ Pharisees: "We keep the law perfectly"
    ├─ Sadducees: "We run the temple"
    └─ Both: "Abraham is our father"
    │
JOHN'S RESPONSE
    │
    └─► Where is the FRUIT?
        │
        ├─ Fruit = Evidence of genuine heart change
        ├─ Fruit = Justice, mercy, humility (Micah 6:8)
        └─ Fruit ≠ Religious performance
```

### One-Line Cut
**Religious pedigree is worthless - God doesn't count ancestors, He counts fruit.**

---

## vv. 11-12: The Coming One

### The Flow

```
v. 11: JOHN'S BAPTISM vs. JESUS' BAPTISM
    │
    JOHN'S BAPTISM:
    │
    ├─ "I baptize you with water"
    └─ "For repentance" ◄── Preparation, symbol
    │
    THE COMING ONE:
    │
    ├─ "More powerful than I"
    ├─ "Whose sandals I am not worthy to carry"
    │   │
    │   └─► Slave's job - even a disciple didn't do this
    │
    └─► "He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire"
        │
        ├─ Holy Spirit ──► Empowerment, indwelling
        └─ Fire ──► Purification OR judgment
    │
v. 12: THE WINNOWING
    │
    └─► "His winnowing fork is in his hand"
        │
        ├─ Winnowing = Separating wheat from chaff
        │   │
        │   ├─ Throw grain in air
        │   ├─ Wind blows chaff away
        │   └─ Wheat falls back down
        │
        ├─ "Gathering his wheat into the barn" ◄── Salvation
        └─ "Burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire" ◄── Judgment
```

### John's Humility

```
COMPARISON
    │
    JOHN                           JESUS
    │                                │
    ├─ "I baptize"                   ├─ "He will baptize"
    ├─ With water                    ├─ With Holy Spirit & fire
    ├─ For repentance                ├─ For transformation
    │                                │
    └─ "Not worthy to carry          └─ The Lord Himself
        His sandals"
```

**Carrying sandals = lowest slave duty. John sees himself as LESS than a slave to Jesus.**

### Water, Spirit, Fire

| Element | John's Baptism | Jesus' Baptism |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Water** | Outward symbol | - |
| **Spirit** | - | Inward transformation (Pentecost) |
| **Fire** | - | Purification OR judgment |

### The Threshing Floor Image

```
THRESHING FLOOR
    │
    ├─ Wheat + chaff mixed together ◄── Israel (& humanity)
    │
    Winnowing fork thrown
    │
    ├─ WHEAT (grain) ──► Falls, gathered into barn ──► SALVATION
    │
    └─ CHAFF (husk) ──► Blown away, burned ──► JUDGMENT
        │
        └─► "Unquenchable fire" ◄── Cannot be put out
```

### One-Line Cut
**John came with water to prepare; Jesus comes with Spirit to transform and fire to judge.**

---

## vv. 13-17: The Baptism of Jesus

### The Flow

```
v. 13: JESUS ARRIVES
    │
    └─► Comes from Galilee to Jordan
        │
        ├─ ~60 mile journey
        └─► Purpose: To be baptized by John

v. 14: JOHN'S OBJECTION
    │
    └─► "I need to be baptized by YOU,
         and do you come to me?"
        │
        ├─ John recognizes who Jesus is
        ├─ Tries to deter Him (διεκώλυεν - imperfect: kept trying)
        └─ The baptizer needs baptism from the One he baptizes

v. 15: JESUS' ANSWER
    │
    └─► "Let it be so now; it is proper for us
         to fulfill all righteousness"
        │
        ├─ "Let it be so NOW" ◄── Temporary necessity
        ├─ "Proper for US" ◄── John participates in God's plan
        └─► John consents

vv. 16-17: HEAVEN RESPONDS
    │
    ├─ "As soon as" ◄── Immediately upon baptism
    │
    ├─ Jesus goes UP out of water
    │
    ├─ Heaven OPENED (σχίζω - torn/split)
    │   │
    │   └─► Same word used at Jesus' death (Mark 15:38)
    │        when temple veil was "torn"
    │
    ├─ SPIRIT descends
    │   │
    │   ├─ "Like a dove" ◄── Visible, gentle, hovering
    │   └─ Alights ON Him ◄── Anointing for ministry
    │
    └─ FATHER speaks:
        │
        └─► "This is my Son, whom I love;
             with him I am well pleased"
            │
            ├─ "My Son" ◄── Psalm 2:7 (coronation psalm)
            ├─ "Whom I love" ◄── Only/beloved Son
            └─ "Well pleased" ◄── Before any public ministry
```

### The Reversal

```
JOHN'S LOGIC                    JESUS' LOGIC
    │                               │
    "I need baptism from you"       "Let it be so now"
    │                               │
    ├─ Greater baptizes lesser      ├─ The Greater becomes lesser
    ├─ You are sinless              ├─ I identify with sinners
    └─ This is backwards            └─ This fulfills righteousness
```

**The King's first public act is to stand in line with sinners.**

### Why Did Jesus Need Baptism?

```
WHY BE BAPTIZED?
    │
    ├─ NOT for repentance ◄── Jesus had no sin
    ├─ NOT for cleansing ◄── He was already pure
    │
    "TO FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS":
    │
    ├─ Identification ◄── Standing with sinful humanity
    │   │
    │   └─► He who knew no sin became sin for us (2 Cor 5:21)
    │
    ├─ Inauguration ◄── Beginning of public ministry
    │   │
    │   └─► Priests began ministry at age 30 (Num 4:3)
    │
    ├─ Anticipation ◄── Pointing to death/resurrection
    │   │
    │   └─► Going down into water, rising up
    │
    └─ Affirmation ◄── Father publicly endorses the Son
```

### The Trinity at Jesus' Baptism

| Person | Action | Significance |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Son** | Baptized, rises from water | Obedient, identified with humanity |
| **Spirit** | Descends like a dove | Anoints Jesus for ministry |
| **Father** | Speaks from heaven | Affirms and validates the Son |

**All three Persons of the Trinity present and active at once - distinct yet unified.**

### The Father's Words

```
"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased"
    │
    ├─ ECHOES PSALM 2:7
    │   │
    │   └─► "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"
    │        (Coronation psalm - the King installed)
    │
    ├─ ECHOES ISAIAH 42:1
    │   │
    │   └─► "Here is my servant, whom I uphold,
    │        my chosen one in whom I delight;
    │        I will put my Spirit on him"
    │        (The Servant of the Lord)
    │
    └─ ECHOES GENESIS 22:2
        │
        └─► "Take your son, your only son, whom you love"
             (Isaac - the beloved son to be sacrificed)

JESUS = King (Psalm 2) + Servant (Isaiah 42) + Sacrifice (Genesis 22)
```

### The Dove

```
WHY A DOVE?
    │
    ├─ Genesis 1:2 ◄── Spirit hovering over waters at creation
    │                   New creation begins
    │
    ├─ Genesis 8:8-12 ◄── Noah's dove signals new world
    │                      New covenant era dawning
    │
    ├─ Gentle, peaceful ◄── Not fire or wind
    │                       The Spirit's gentle work
    │
    └─ Visible ◄── Tangible sign others could see
                   Public anointing for public ministry
```

### One-Line Cut
**The sinless One enters sinner's waters - and heaven tears open as Father, Son, and Spirit unite in the mission to rescue humanity.**
