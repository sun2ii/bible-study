## vv. 1-11: The Temptation of Jesus

### The Setup

```
v. 1: THE SPIRIT LEADS
    │
    └─► "Jesus was LED by the Spirit into the wilderness
         to be TEMPTED by the devil"
        │
        ├─ Not accident ◄── Intentional
        ├─ Not Satan's idea ◄── Spirit's leading
        └─ Purpose: TO BE TESTED
    │
v. 2: THE CONTEXT
    │
    ├─ 40 days and 40 nights fasting
    │   │
    │   └─► 40 = Testing number in Scripture
    │       ├─ Israel: 40 years in wilderness
    │       ├─ Moses: 40 days on Sinai (twice)
    │       ├─ Elijah: 40 days to Horeb
    │       └─ Noah: 40 days of rain
    │
    └─► "He was hungry" ◄── Understatement. Near death.
```

### The Three Temptations

```
TEMPTATION 1: BREAD (vv. 3-4)
    │
    Satan: "IF you are the Son of God,
            tell these stones to become bread"
    │
    ├─ Attack on: PHYSICAL NEED (appetite)
    ├─ The "if": Doubt His identity? Or "since you are..."
    ├─ The trap: Use divine power for personal comfort
    │
    Jesus: "It is written:
            'Man shall not live on bread alone,
            but on every word from the mouth of God'"
    │
    └─► Quote: Deuteronomy 8:3
        │
        └─► Context: Israel fed with manna to learn
            dependence on God's word, not just food

TEMPTATION 2: SPECTACLE (vv. 5-7)
    │
    Satan takes Him to highest point of temple
    │
    Satan: "IF you are the Son of God, throw yourself down.
            For it is written:
            'He will command his angels concerning you...
            they will lift you up...'"
    │
    ├─ Attack on: PRIDE / PROVING HIMSELF
    ├─ Satan quotes Scripture! (Psalm 91:11-12)
    ├─ The trap: Force God's hand, demand miraculous rescue
    │
    Jesus: "It is ALSO written:
            'Do not put the Lord your God to the test'"
    │
    └─► Quote: Deuteronomy 6:16
        │
        └─► Context: Israel tested God at Massah,
            demanding "Is the LORD among us or not?"

TEMPTATION 3: KINGDOMS (vv. 8-10)
    │
    Satan takes Him to very high mountain
    Shows all kingdoms of the world
    │
    Satan: "All this I will give you
            IF you will bow down and worship me"
    │
    ├─ Attack on: AMBITION / SHORTCUT TO GLORY
    ├─ No "if you are Son of God" ◄── Drops pretense
    ├─ The trap: Gain the world without the cross
    │
    Jesus: "Away from me, Satan!
            For it is written:
            'Worship the Lord your God,
            and serve him only'"
    │
    └─► Quote: Deuteronomy 6:13
        │
        └─► Context: Israel warned against worshiping
            other gods when they enter the land

v. 11: THE RESULT
    │
    ├─ "Then the devil LEFT him"
    └─ "Angels came and attended him"
```

### Jesus vs. Israel: The True Son

```
ISRAEL IN WILDERNESS              JESUS IN WILDERNESS
(40 YEARS)                        (40 DAYS)
    │                                 │
    ├─ Hungry → Complained            ├─ Hungry → Trusted
    │  "Give us bread!"               │  "Man lives by God's word"
    │  (Exodus 16)                    │
    │                                 │
    ├─ Tested God at Massah           ├─ Refused to test God
    │  "Is the LORD among us?"        │  "Do not put God to test"
    │  (Exodus 17)                    │
    │                                 │
    ├─ Worshiped golden calf          ├─ Worshiped God alone
    │  (Exodus 32)                    │  "Serve Him only"
    │                                 │
    └─ FAILED                         └─ PASSED

JESUS = The True Israel who succeeds where Israel failed
```

### The Pattern of Attack

| Temptation | Target | Satan's Offer | Jesus' Response |
|------------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Bread** | Body (appetite) | Satisfy yourself | Trust God's provision |
| **Temple** | Soul (pride) | Prove yourself | Trust God's timing |
| **Mountain** | Spirit (ambition) | Exalt yourself | Worship God only |

### All Quotes from Deuteronomy

```
WHY DEUTERONOMY?
    │
    ├─ "Deuteronomy" = "Second Law"
    │
    ├─ Moses' final speeches to Israel
    │   BEFORE entering the Promised Land
    │
    ├─ Theme: Remember what God did in wilderness
    │         Don't repeat the failures
    │
    └─► Jesus quotes the WILDERNESS book
        to WIN in the wilderness
```

| Quote | Reference | Israel's Failure |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| "Man shall not live by bread alone..." | Deut 8:3 | Grumbled for food |
| "Do not put the Lord your God to the test" | Deut 6:16 | Tested at Massah |
| "Worship the Lord your God and serve him only" | Deut 6:13 | Golden calf |

### Satan's Strategy

```
THE "IF" ATTACKS
    │
    ├─ "IF you are the Son of God" (v. 3)
    │   │
    │   └─► Father just said "This IS my Son" (3:17)
    │       Satan immediately questions it
    │
    ├─ "IF you are the Son of God" (v. 6)
    │   │
    │   └─► Prove it. Make God prove it.
    │
    └─ [No "if" in v. 9]
        │
        └─► Final offer: Skip identity, just worship me

SATAN USES SCRIPTURE (v. 6)
    │
    ├─ Quotes Psalm 91:11-12 ◄── Real Scripture
    │
    ├─ BUT misapplies it
    │   │
    │   └─► Psalm 91 = God protects those who trust Him
    │       NOT = Test God by forcing His hand
    │
    └─► Lesson: Even Scripture can be weaponized
        Context matters. Intent matters.
```

### One-Line Cut
**Where Israel failed for 40 years, Jesus succeeds in 40 days - the True Son passes the test using only the Word.**

## vv. 12-17: Ministry Begins in Galilee

### The Flow

```
v. 12: JOHN ARRESTED
    │
    └─► Jesus "withdrew to Galilee"
        │
        ├─ John's arrest = signal to begin
        └─ Strategic retreat? Or advancing the mission?

v. 13: RELOCATION
    │
    ├─ Left Nazareth (hometown)
    │
    └─► Lived in Capernaum
        │
        ├─ "By the lake" ◄── Sea of Galilee
        └─ "In the area of Zebulun and Naphtali"

vv. 14-16: PROPHECY FULFILLED (Isaiah 9:1-2)
    │
    └─► "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
         the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan,
         Galilee of the Gentiles—
         the people living in darkness
         have seen a great light;
         on those living in the land of the shadow of death
         a light has dawned."
    │
    ├─ DARKNESS ──► LIGHT
    ├─ SHADOW OF DEATH ──► LIGHT DAWNED
    └─ "Galilee of the Gentiles" ◄── Mixed, looked down on

v. 17: THE MESSAGE
    │
    └─► "From that time on Jesus began to preach:
         'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.'"
        │
        └─► Same message as John (3:2)
            But different authority: John announced,
            Jesus IS the kingdom
```

### Why Galilee?

```
GALILEE'S REPUTATION
    │
    ├─ "Galilee of the Gentiles" ◄── Mixed population
    ├─ Far from Jerusalem ◄── Religious backwater
    ├─ "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" (John 1:46)
    │
    BUT ISAIAH PROPHESIED:
    │
    ├─ The FIRST place to fall to Assyria (732 BC)
    │   would be the FIRST to see the light
    │
    └─► The despised place becomes the blessed place
```

### One-Line Cut
**Light dawns first in the darkest, most despised place - the backwater of Galilee sees the King before Jerusalem.**

---

## vv. 18-22: Calling the First Disciples

### The Flow

```
vv. 18-20: PETER & ANDREW
    │
    ├─ Location: Walking beside Sea of Galilee
    │
    ├─ Who: Simon (Peter) and Andrew, brothers
    │
    ├─ Occupation: Fishermen, casting nets
    │
    ├─ Jesus' call: "Come, follow me,
    │               and I will send you out
    │               to fish for people"
    │   │
    │   ├─ "Come" ◄── Invitation
    │   ├─ "Follow me" ◄── Relationship
    │   └─ "Fish for people" ◄── Mission (using their skill)
    │
    └─► Response: "AT ONCE they left their nets
                   and followed him"

vv. 21-22: JAMES & JOHN
    │
    ├─ Location: Going on from there
    │
    ├─ Who: James and John, sons of Zebedee
    │
    ├─ Situation: In boat with father, preparing nets
    │
    ├─ Jesus called them
    │
    └─► Response: "IMMEDIATELY they left
                   the boat AND their father
                   and followed him"
```

### The Cost

| Disciples | What They Left |
|-----------|---------------|
| Peter & Andrew | Nets (livelihood) |
| James & John | Boat (livelihood) + Father (family) |

### The Pattern

```
THE CALL
    │
    ├─ Jesus initiates ◄── He calls, they respond
    │
    ├─ Simple words ◄── "Follow me"
    │
    ├─ Immediate response ◄── "At once" / "Immediately"
    │
    └─ Total commitment ◄── Left everything
```

### One-Line Cut
**No negotiation, no delay - "Follow me" demands everything and gets it.**

---

    │   ├─ Those having seizures
    │   └─ The paralyzed

        ├─ Decapolis (10 Greek cities)
        ├─ Jerusalem
        ├─ Judea
        └─ Region across the Jordan
```

### One-Line Cut
**Word + deed together - Jesus doesn't just talk about the kingdom, He demonstrates it with every healing.**
