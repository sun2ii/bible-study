### The 14-14-14 Structure

```
Abraham ────► David ────► Exile ────► Jesus
   14           14          14
 generations  generations  generations

 PROMISE      KINGDOM      RESTORATION
```

### Why 14? Hebrew Gematria (Letters = Numbers)

```
Hebrew has no separate numerals - letters ARE numbers:

א (Aleph) = 1       י (Yod)   = 10      ק (Qof)  = 100
ב (Bet)   = 2       כ (Kaf)   = 20      ר (Resh) = 200
ג (Gimel) = 3       ל (Lamed) = 30      ש (Shin) = 300
ד (Dalet) = 4       מ (Mem)   = 40      ת (Tav)  = 400
ה (He)    = 5       נ (Nun)   = 50
ו (Vav)   = 6       ס (Samek) = 60
ז (Zayin) = 7       ע (Ayin)  = 70
ח (Chet)  = 8       פ (Pe)    = 80
ט (Tet)   = 9       צ (Tsade) = 90
```

**"David" in Hebrew = דוד**

```
דוד (read right to left: D-V-D)
│││
││└─ ד (Dalet) = 4
│└── ו (Vav)   = 6
└─── ד (Dalet) = 4
                ───
                 14
```

**Matthew structured his genealogy in 14s to declare:**
**"DAVID! DAVID! DAVID! - This Jesus is the promised King!"**

### Key Figures

| Person | Role | Significance |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Abraham** | Covenant Father | "All nations blessed through you" (Gen 12) |
| **Judah** | Tribe of Kings | Chosen over older brothers |
| **David** | King | Messianic covenant (2 Sam 7) |
| **Solomon** | Mixed | Wisdom + idolatry (1 Kings 11) |
| **Rehoboam** | Bad | Kingdom divided (1 Kings 12) |
| **Hezekiah** | Good | Revival, trusted God (2 Kings 18-20) |
| **Manasseh** | Worst | 55 years of evil, later repented (2 Chr 33) |
| **Josiah** | Best | Found the Law, great reform (2 Kings 22-23) |
| **Jeconiah** | Cursed | Exiled to Babylon (Jer 22:30) |

### The Women (Grace Breaking In)

| Woman | How Named | Background | Story |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Tamar** | by name | Canaanite | Desperate measures, vindicated (Gen 38) |
| **Rahab** | by name | Canaanite prostitute | Faith saved her family (Josh 2) |
| **Ruth** | by name | Moabite foreigner | Loyalty and redemption (Book of Ruth) |
| **Bathsheba** | "Uriah's wife" | Israelite | Emphasizes David's sin - adultery + murder (2 Sam 11) |
| **Mary** | by name | Virgin | "mother of Jesus" - breaks the pattern: no father listed (Matt 1:16) |

### One-Line Cut
**The Messiah's bloodline includes outsiders, scandals, and broken kings - grace was always the plan.**

## vv. 18-25: Birth of Jesus

### The Problem → Solution → Fulfillment

```
THE PROBLEM (vv. 18-19)
    │
    Mary pregnant ──► Joseph not the father
    │
    Joseph's dilemma:
    ├─ Faithful to Law → Must divorce
    └─ Loves Mary     → Quietly, not publicly

THE SOLUTION (vv. 20-21)
    │
    Angel appears in dream
    │
    ├─ "Joseph, son of David" ◄── Legal lineage matters
    │
    ├─ "Do not be afraid"
    │
    ├─ "Conceived by Holy Spirit" ◄── Virgin birth
    │
    └─ "Name him Jesus" ◄── יֵשׁוּעַ (Yeshua) = "YHWH saves"
        │
        └─► "He will save his people from their sins"

THE FULFILLMENT (vv. 22-25)
    │
    Isaiah 7:14 prophecy fulfilled:
    │
    ├─ "Virgin will conceive" ✓
    │
    ├─ "Give birth to a son" ✓
    │
    └─ "Call him Immanuel" = "God with us"
        │
        Joseph obeys:
        ├─ Takes Mary as wife
        ├─ No consummation until birth
        └─ Names him Jesus
```

### Two Names, One Identity

| Name | Meaning | Emphasis |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Jesus** | "YHWH saves" | What He does - saves from sins |
| **Immanuel** | "God with us" | Who He is - God incarnate |

### Joseph's Role

| Action | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Accepts Mary | Protects her honor |
| Names Jesus | Legal adoption - grants Davidic lineage |
| Doesn't consummate | Confirms virgin birth |

### One-Line Cut
**Joseph's "yes" gave Jesus His legal right to David's throne - adoption completes what blood cannot.**

## Cross-References
- Genesis 12:1-3 - Abrahamic covenant
- 2 Samuel 7:12-16 - Davidic covenant
- Ruth 4:18-22 - Genealogy overlap

## Personal Notes

### 3.14 (Pi Day)

```
My birthday: March 14 = 3/14 = π (Pi)

3 sections × 14 generations = Matthew's structure
│              │
└──────────────┴──► 3.14

π = 3.14159...
├─ Infinite, non-repeating
├─ Defines every circle
└─ Foundation of all geometry

The 3.14 pattern:
├─ 3 eras of waiting
├─ 14 steps each
└─ All circling toward ONE person: Jesus
```

God speaks through patterns we recognize personally.
Not coincidence - invitation to pay attention.
