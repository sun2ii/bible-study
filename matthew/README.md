# Matthew - The King

## Overview
Matthew presents Jesus as the promised Messiah-King, the Son of David who fulfills Old Testament prophecy.

**Author:** Matthew (Levi), tax collector turned disciple      
**Audience:** Jewish believers    
**Theme:** Jesus is the King of the Jews      
**Key Phrase:** "This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet..."    
  
## Why Four Gospels?

Same Jesus, four angles - like four witnesses describing the same person to different people.

```
THE FOUR GOSPELS
    │
    ├─ MATTHEW → The KING
    ├─ MARK    → The SERVANT
    ├─ LUKE    → The MAN
    └─ JOHN    → The GOD
```

### The Four Audiences (Then & Now)

| Gospel | Original Audience | Modern Equivalent | What They Cared About |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Matthew** | Jews | Religious people | "Does this match Scripture? Is He legit?" |
| **Mark** | Romans | Busy professionals | "What did He DO? Get to the point." |
| **Luke** | Greeks | Intellectuals, seekers | "Is this historically accurate? Does He care about people like me?" |
| **John** | Everyone | Spiritual seekers | "Who IS He really? How do I know God?" |

### What This Means Practically

```
MATTHEW (The King)
    │
    WHO: Written for people who already knew the Old Testament
    │
    STYLE: Constantly quotes prophecy - "This fulfilled what was written..."
    │
    MODERN: For you if you're asking "How does Jesus connect to
            the bigger story? Show me the receipts."
    │
    VIBE: Legal brief, evidence-based, systematic

MARK (The Servant)
    │
    WHO: Written for action-oriented Romans who valued power & results
    │
    STYLE: Fast-paced, uses "immediately" 40+ times, shortest Gospel
    │
    MODERN: For you if you're asking "What did Jesus actually DO?
            Skip the backstory."
    │
    VIBE: Action movie, no fluff, pure momentum

LUKE (The Man)
    │
    WHO: Written for educated Greeks who valued humanity & compassion
    │
    STYLE: Most detailed, includes outsiders (women, poor, Samaritans)
    │
    MODERN: For you if you're asking "Does Jesus care about
            broken people? Is this real history?"
    │
    VIBE: Documentary, investigative journalism, inclusive

JOHN (The God)
    │
    WHO: Written for anyone asking the ultimate question
    │
    STYLE: Theological, reflective, "I AM" statements, signs
    │
    MODERN: For you if you're asking "Is Jesus actually God?
            What does it mean to believe?"
    │
    VIBE: Philosophy, meditation, deep reflection
```

### How Each Gospel Begins (This Tells You Everything)

| Gospel | First Words | What It Reveals |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Matthew** | Genealogy from Abraham | A King needs credentials - "Here's His royal bloodline" |
| **Mark** | "The beginning of the gospel" | A Servant needs no pedigree - "Let's get to work" |
| **Luke** | Detailed historical intro, then genealogy to Adam | Connecting Jesus to ALL humanity, not just Jews |
| **John** | "In the beginning was the Word" | God has no beginning - He just IS |

### Why Does Matthew Focus on "The King"?

```
MATTHEW'S FOCUS
    │
    ├─ ~60 Old Testament quotes
    │   └─► "This was to fulfill what the prophet said..."
    │       Every major event links back to prophecy
    │
    ├─ "Kingdom of heaven" appears 32 times
    │   └─► Only Matthew uses this phrase
    │       (Jews avoided saying "God" directly)
    │
    ├─ Genealogy starts with Abraham
    │   └─► Father of the Jewish nation
    │       Proves Jesus is the promised Jewish Messiah
    │
    └─ The big question Matthew answers:
        │
        └─► "Is Jesus the King we've been waiting for?"
            │
            └─► Matthew's answer: YES. Here's 28 chapters of proof.
