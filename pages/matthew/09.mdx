# Matthew 9: Authority Expanded

> Jesus' authority reaches where religion can't: He forgives sins (shocking the scribes), calls tax collectors (offending the pious), raises the dead (silencing the mourners). The religious leaders see law-breaking; Jesus sees harvest. Old wineskins can't hold new wine. The chapter ends with sheep without a shepherd—harassed, helpless, waiting for workers. The authority is real; the question is who will carry it.

---

## The Logical Chain

```
AUTHORITY DEMONSTRATED
    │
    ├─► Ch. 8: Authority over NATURE (storm, demons, disease)
    │
    └─► Ch. 9: Authority over SIN, DEATH, TRADITION
            │
            └─► This is harder to prove
                │
                ├─ Sin forgiveness is INVISIBLE
                │   └─► So Jesus heals to PROVE He can forgive
                │
                ├─ Death is FINAL
                │   └─► So Jesus raises to PROVE He conquered it
                │
                └─ Tradition is SACRED
                    └─► So Jesus reframes to PROVE He's the source

THE THREAD: Not just power, but PURPOSE
    │
    └─► "I desire MERCY, not sacrifice" (v. 13)
        │
        └─► Jesus didn't come to impress
            He came to HEAL the sick
            He came to CALL sinners
            He came to SEEK the lost
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. Paralytic (vv. 1-8) — FORGIVENESS

```
THE SCENE
    │
    ├─ Paralyzed man on a mat
    ├─ Friends carry him to Jesus
    │
    └─► "When Jesus saw THEIR faith..."
        │
        └─► Not his faith alone
            Community faith matters
```

```
THE SHOCK
    │
    ├─ Expected: "Get up and walk"
    │
    └─► Actual: "Your SINS are forgiven"
            │
            └─► Wait - he came for HEALING
                Why start with FORGIVENESS?
                │
                └─► Because sin is the deeper problem
                    Paralysis is the symptom
                    Sin is the root
```

```
THE LOGIC
    │
    ├─ Teachers of law: "Blasphemy!"
    │   └─► Only GOD can forgive sins
    │       They're right about this
    │
    └─► Jesus' response:
        │
        ├─ "Which is EASIER to say?"
        │   ├─ "Your sins are forgiven" (can't verify)
        │   └─ "Get up and walk" (immediately testable)
        │
        └─► "So that you may KNOW the Son of Man
             has authority on earth to forgive sins..."
            │
            └─► The healing PROVES the forgiveness
                The visible validates the invisible
```

| What They Saw | What It Proved |
|---------------|----------------|
| Man gets up | Jesus can heal |
| Man walks home | Jesus has authority |
| → Therefore | He CAN forgive sins |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I bring my whole self to Jesus—not just symptoms but the root?*

**One-line:** The healing you can see proves the forgiveness you can't.

---

### 2. Matthew's Call (vv. 9-13) — CALLING

**Key Greek:** ἁμαρτωλός (hamartōlos) — "sinner" (one who misses the mark)

```
THE CALL
    │
    ├─ "Follow me"
    │   └─► Two words
    │       No argument
    │       No negotiation
    │
    └─► "Matthew got up and followed"
        │
        └─► Tax collectors = traitors
            Working for Rome
            Ritually unclean
            Socially outcast
```

```
THE DINNER
    │
    ├─ At Matthew's house
    ├─ Many tax collectors and sinners
    ├─ Eating WITH Jesus
    │
    └─► Table fellowship = acceptance
        You don't eat with people you reject
        │
        └─► Pharisees: "Why does your teacher
             eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
```

```
THE ANSWER
    │
    └─► "It is not the HEALTHY who need a doctor,
         but the SICK."
            │
            ├─ Not: "They're not really that bad"
            ├─ IS: "They're sick. I'm the doctor."
            │
            └─► "I desire MERCY, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6)
                │
                └─► God wants HEART over RITUAL
                    Compassion over correctness
                    │
                    └─► "I came to call SINNERS"
                        Not the self-righteous
                        Those who know they're sick
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see myself as the sick one needing the doctor, or the healthy one judging others?*

**One-line:** Doctors go to the sick; Jesus goes to sinners.

---

### 3. Fasting Question (vv. 14-17) — NEWNESS

**Key insight:** John's disciples and Pharisees both fasted. Jesus' disciples didn't. Why?

```
THE QUESTION
    │
    └─► "Why do we and the Pharisees fast,
         but YOUR disciples do not?"
            │
            └─► Fair question
                Fasting = piety
                Jesus' followers seem... casual?
```

```
THE BRIDEGROOM ANSWER
    │
    └─► "Can wedding guests MOURN
         while the bridegroom is WITH them?"
            │
            ├─ Bridegroom = Jesus
            ├─ Wedding = NOW (His presence)
            │
            └─► "The time will come when the bridegroom
                 will be TAKEN from them;
                 THEN they will fast."
                    │
                    └─► Fasting has its place
                        But presence changes everything
                        You don't mourn at a wedding
```

```
THE NEW WINE ANSWER
    │
    ├─ OLD GARMENT + NEW PATCH = Tear worse
    │
    ├─ OLD WINESKINS + NEW WINE = Burst
    │
    └─► Jesus isn't patching the old system
        He's bringing something ENTIRELY NEW
            │
            └─► New covenant
                New relationship
                New wineskins required
```

| Old System | New Reality |
|------------|-------------|
| Fast to earn favor | Feast because He's here |
| Sacrifice for merit | Mercy already given |
| Rules to follow | Relationship to enjoy |

**Diagnostic:** *Am I trying to fit Jesus into my old religious framework, or letting Him create something new?*

**One-line:** You can't patch the new onto the old—Jesus requires new wineskins.

---

### 4. Jairus' Daughter (vv. 18-19, 23-26) — DEATH

```
THE REQUEST
    │
    ├─ Synagogue leader (respectable, named Jairus in Mark/Luke)
    ├─ Daughter "has just DIED"
    │
    └─► "Come put your hand on her,
         and she will LIVE"
            │
            └─► Extraordinary faith
                He believes Jesus can reverse death
```

```
THE SCENE
    │
    ├─ Noisy crowd, mourners, flute players
    │   └─► Professional grief
    │
    ├─ Jesus: "The girl is not dead but ASLEEP"
    │
    └─► They LAUGHED at him
        │
        └─► They knew death when they saw it
            Jesus redefines what they're seeing
```

```
THE MIRACLE
    │
    ├─ Crowd put outside
    ├─ Jesus took her by the HAND
    │
    └─► She got up
        │
        └─► News spread through all the region
            Death is not final for Jesus
```

**One-line:** What looks like death to everyone else is sleep to Jesus.

---

### 5. Bleeding Woman (vv. 20-22) — FAITH

**Key insight:** 12 years of bleeding = 12 years of ritual uncleanness, isolation, shame.

```
THE DESPERATION
    │
    ├─ 12 years of bleeding
    │   ├─ Ritually unclean (Lev 15)
    │   ├─ Everything she touched = unclean
    │   ├─ Excluded from temple, community
    │   └─ Doctors had failed (Mark 5:26)
    │
    └─► She came up BEHIND him
        │
        └─► She's not supposed to be in crowds
            She makes everyone she touches unclean
            But she reaches anyway
```

```
THE TOUCH
    │
    ├─ "If I only touch his CLOAK,
    │    I will be healed"
    │
    └─► Her logic: His holiness > my uncleanness
        │
        └─► Usually: uncleanness contaminates
            With Jesus: holiness overwhelms
```

```
THE HEALING
    │
    ├─ Jesus turns and SEES her
    │   └─► She's not hidden from Him
    │
    ├─ "Take heart, DAUGHTER"
    │   └─► Same word as to the paralytic: "son"
    │       Relational language
    │
    └─► "Your FAITH has healed you"
        │
        └─► Not: "My cloak healed you"
            IS: "Your faith—reaching for me—healed you"
```

**Diagnostic:** *Am I reaching for Jesus even when I feel disqualified?*

**One-line:** Her uncleanness didn't contaminate Jesus; His holiness cleansed her.

---

### 6. Two Blind Men (vv. 27-31) — SIGHT

**Key phrase:** "Son of David" — Messianic title

```
THE CRY
    │
    └─► "Have mercy on us, SON OF DAVID!"
            │
            └─► They can't SEE
                But they RECOGNIZE who He is
                │
                └─► Physical blindness ≠ spiritual blindness
                    Often the opposite
```

```
THE TEST
    │
    ├─ Jesus doesn't heal immediately
    ├─ Waits until they come INDOORS
    │
    └─► "Do you BELIEVE that I am able to do this?"
            │
            └─► He wants their faith declared
                Not just assumed
                │
                └─► "Yes, Lord"
```

```
THE HEALING
    │
    ├─ Touched their eyes
    │
    └─► "According to your FAITH
         let it be done to you"
            │
            └─► Faith is the conduit
                Not the cause (Jesus is)
                But the channel
```

```
THE COMMAND IGNORED
    │
    ├─ "See that NO ONE knows about this"
    │   └─► Messianic secret (why?)
    │       - Timing not yet right
    │       - Political expectations wrong
    │
    └─► They spread the news EVERYWHERE
        │
        └─► Understandable but disobedient
```

**One-line:** The blind saw what the sighted missed: the Son of David.

---

### 7. Mute Demoniac (vv. 32-34) — SPEECH

```
THE SCENE
    │
    ├─ Demon-possessed
    ├─ Could not TALK
    │
    └─► Brought to Jesus (pattern: others bring the broken)
```

```
THE RESULT
    │
    ├─ Demon driven out
    ├─ Man SPOKE
    │
    └─► Crowd: "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel"
```

```
THE OPPOSITION
    │
    └─► Pharisees: "It is by the PRINCE OF DEMONS
         that he drives out demons"
            │
            └─► Same evidence, opposite conclusion
                │
                ├─ Crowd: "This is from God!"
                └─ Pharisees: "This is from Satan!"
                    │
                    └─► They cannot deny the miracle
                        So they attack the SOURCE
                        │
                        └─► This escalates in Ch. 12
```

**One-line:** Same miracle, two verdicts—the heart determines what the eyes see.

---

### 8. Harvest Prayer (vv. 35-38) — COMPASSION

**Key Greek:** σπλαγχνίζομαι (splanchnizomai) — "to be moved in the bowels" (gut-level compassion)

```
JESUS' RHYTHM
    │
    ├─ Teaching in synagogues
    ├─ Proclaiming good news of the kingdom
    ├─ Healing every disease and sickness
    │
    └─► All three together
        Word + deed
        Proclamation + demonstration
```

```
JESUS' VISION
    │
    └─► "When he saw the crowds..."
            │
            └─► What did He see?
                │
                ├─ "HARASSED" (ἐσκυλμένοι) = troubled, distressed
                ├─ "HELPLESS" (ἐρριμμένοι) = thrown down, abandoned
                │
                └─► "Like SHEEP without a SHEPHERD"
                    │
                    └─► Not their fault
                        Their leaders failed them
                        They're wandering
                        They're vulnerable
```

```
JESUS' RESPONSE
    │
    ├─ COMPASSION (gut-level moved)
    │
    └─► "The HARVEST is plentiful
         but the WORKERS are few."
            │
            ├─ Not: "The problem is too big"
            ├─ IS: "The opportunity is huge"
            │
            └─► "ASK the Lord of the harvest
                 to SEND OUT workers
                 into his harvest field."
                    │
                    └─► Ch. 10: He sends the Twelve
                        The answer to the prayer
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see crowds as problems or harvest? Do I pray for workers?*

**One-line:** Jesus saw lost people and felt it in His gut—then mobilized workers.

---

## Unified Framework

```
MATTHEW 9: AUTHORITY FOR THE BROKEN
    │

    │
    ├─ CALLING: For the outcast by society

    ├─ NEWNESS: For the trapped in old religion
    │

        │
        └─► "I desire MERCY, not sacrifice"
            The heartbeat of the chapter
```

---

## Diagnostic Summary

| Section | Core Question |
|---------|---------------|
| Paralytic | Do I bring my sin, not just my symptoms? |
| Matthew | Do I see myself as sick needing the doctor? |
| Fasting | Am I trying to patch new onto old? |
| Jairus | Do I believe Jesus can reverse the irreversible? |
| Bleeding woman | Am I reaching even when disqualified? |
| Blind men | Do I recognize Jesus even when I can't see? |
| Mute demoniac | What does my heart conclude from evidence? |
| Harvest | Do I see lost people with compassion? |

---

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Matthew 9:** Jesus demonstrates authority over sin, death, demons, and disease—not to impress but to heal, because He came for the sick, not the self-righteous.
