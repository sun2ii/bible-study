# Matthew 3 - The King's Anointing

> After 400 years of prophetic silence, God speaks—through a wild man in camel hair. The silence wasn't absence but anticipation. John's message is simple: repent, because the kingdom is here. And at Jesus' baptism, the Trinity appears together for the first time in Scripture—Father, Son, Spirit—declaring the King's identity before His mission begins.
