# Matthew 5 - The King's Manifesto

> The kingdom's values are upside-down from the world's. Blessed are the poor, the mourning, the meek, the persecuted—not the rich, happy, powerful, and popular. Jesus doesn't lower the Law's standard; He intensifies it, moving from external compliance to internal transformation. Murder starts in the heart. Adultery begins in the eyes. The King demands not just behavior, but being.

## The Upside-Down Kingdom

| World Says Blessed | Jesus Says Blessed |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Rich | Poor in spirit |
| Happy, entertained | Those who mourn |
| Powerful, assertive | The meek |
| Satisfied | Those who hunger |
| Those receiving mercy | Those giving mercy |
| Sophisticated | Pure in heart |
| Warriors | Peacemakers |
| Popular | Persecuted |

### One-Line Cut
**The kingdom's citizens look nothing like the world expects - blessed are the broken, hungry, merciful, and persecuted.**

## Salt and Light

### One-Line Cut
**You don't become salt and light - you ARE, so act like it or become useless.**

## The Six Antitheses

```
THE TRAJECTORY: EXTERNAL → INTERNAL
    │
    LAW                         JESUS
    │                           │
    Don't kill          →       Don't hate
    Don't cheat         →       Don't fantasize
    File papers         →       Honor covenant
    Swear truthfully    →       BE truthful
    Limit revenge       →       Absorb wrong
    Love friends        →       Love enemies
```

### Murder → Anger
**One-Line Cut:** Murder begins in the heart - anger unchecked is murder waiting to happen.

### Adultery → Lust
**One-Line Cut:** The eye that lingers has already betrayed - cut off what leads to sin before sin cuts you off.

### Oaths → Truthfulness
**One-Line Cut:** If you need an oath to be believed, your word is already worthless - let yes mean yes.

### Retaliation → Non-resistance
**One-Line Cut:** The world escalates - kingdom citizens absorb, surprise, and overcome evil with unexpected generosity.

### Neighbor → Enemy Love
**One-Line Cut:** To love only the lovable requires nothing - to love enemies proves whose child you are.
