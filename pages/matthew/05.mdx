# Matthew 5 - The King's Manifesto

> The kingdom's values are upside-down from the world's. Blessed are the poor, the mourning, the meek, the persecuted—not the rich, happy, powerful, and popular. Jesus doesn't lower the Law's standard; He intensifies it, moving from external compliance to internal transformation. Murder starts in the heart. Adultery begins in the eyes. The King demands not just behavior, but being.

## Overview

Jesus ascends a mountain (echoing Moses on Sinai) and delivers the most famous sermon in history - the constitution of His kingdom. This is not advice for better living; it's the manifesto of an upside-down kingdom where the last are first, the mourning are blessed, and loving enemies proves whose children we are.

**Greek Context**:
- ὄρος (oros) - "mountain" → Deliberate Sinai parallel (Exodus 19-20)
- μαθηταί (mathētai) - "disciples" → Learners, followers, those being shaped
- ἐδίδασκεν (edidasken) - "was teaching" → Continuous action, ongoing instruction

## Movement 1: The Setting (vv. 1-2)

### The Text
> **¹** Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. **²** And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying...

### The New Moses

```
MOSES ON SINAI                    JESUS ON THE MOUNTAIN
│                                 │
├─ Exodus 19-20                   ├─ Matthew 5-7
├─ Given the Law                  ├─ Fulfills the Law
├─ Stone tablets                  ├─ Living Word
├─ External commands              ├─ Internal transformation
└─ "Thou shalt not..."            └─ "Blessed are..."
    │                                 │
    OLD COVENANT                      NEW COVENANT
```

**Greek Detail**:
- καθίσαντος αὐτοῦ (kathisantos autou) - "when he sat down" → Rabbinic teaching posture, authoritative position
- ἀνοίξας τὸ στόμα (anoixas to stoma) - "opening his mouth" → Solemn, significant pronouncement

### Diagnostic: Who is this sermon for?
- **Primary audience**: Disciples (v. 1) - those already following
- **Secondary audience**: Crowds (v. 1, 7:28) - those observing
- **Not**: A ladder to climb to become a Christian
- **But**: A description of what kingdom citizens look like

---

## Movement 2: The Beatitudes (vv. 3-12)

### The Core Word: BLESSED

```
μακάριος (makarios)
│
├─ NOT: "Happy" (emotional state, circumstantial)
├─ NOT: "Fortunate" (luck, chance)
│
└─ BUT: "Blessed" (God's favor, deep satisfaction, ultimate flourishing)
    │
    ├─ Independent of circumstances
    ├─ Rooted in God's kingdom reality
    └─ Countercultural and paradoxical
```

### The Eight Beatitudes (+ Ninth Expansion)

#### 1. Blessed are the poor in spirit (v. 3)

**Greek**: οἱ πτωχοὶ τῷ πνεύματι (hoi ptōchoi tō pneumati)
- πτωχός (ptochos) = utterly destitute, beggarly (not just "poor")
- τῷ πνεύματι (tō pneumati) = "in spirit" → spiritual bankruptcy awareness

```
THE FIRST BEATITUDE: POVERTY OF SPIRIT
│
├─ NOT: Material poverty (though often linked)
├─ NOT: False humility or self-deprecation
│
└─ BUT: Honest recognition of spiritual bankruptcy
    │
    ├─ "I have nothing to offer God"
    ├─ "I cannot save myself"
    └─ "I am spiritually destitute without Him"
        │
        └─► "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven"
            │
            PARADOX: The spiritually bankrupt inherit everything
```

**One-Line**: The kingdom belongs to those who know they have nothing to bring.

#### 2. Blessed are those who mourn (v. 4)

**Greek**: οἱ πενθοῦντες (hoi penthountes)
- πενθέω (pentheō) = deep mourning, lamenting (often for the dead)

```
THE SECOND BEATITUDE: MOURNING
│
├─ Mourning WHAT?
│   │
│   ├─ Personal sin
│   ├─ The world's brokenness
│   ├─ Distance from God
│   └─ Others' lostness
│
└─► "for they shall be comforted"
    │
    ├─ By whom? The Comforter (Holy Spirit)
    ├─ When? Now (partial) + Then (complete)
    └─ How? God binds up the brokenhearted
        │
        PARADOX: Those who weep now will laugh forever
```

**Cross-Reference**: Isaiah 61:1-3 - "to comfort all who mourn... giving them a crown of beauty instead of ashes"

**One-Line**: Those who mourn their sin and the world's evil will find God himself as their comfort.

#### 3. Blessed are the meek (v. 5)

**Greek**: οἱ πραεῖς (hoi praeis)
- πραΰς (praus) = gentle, humble, controlled strength (NOT weakness)

```
THE THIRD BEATITUDE: MEEKNESS
│
├─ MEEK ≠ WEAK
│   │
│   └─ Power under control (like a war horse bridled)
│
├─ EXAMPLES:
│   │
│   ├─ Moses: "most meek man on earth" (Num 12:3) - yet led Israel out of Egypt
│   └─ Jesus: "gentle and lowly" (Matt 11:29) - yet overturned tables, confronted Pharisees
│
└─► "for they shall inherit the earth"
    │
    ├─ NOT: Heaven (that was beatitude 1)
    ├─ BUT: Earth - the renewed creation
    │
    PARADOX: The non-grasping inherit everything
```

**Cross-Reference**: Psalm 37:11 - "But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace"

**One-Line**: Those who don't grasp for power will inherit the whole earth.

#### 4. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness (v. 6)

**Greek**: οἱ πεινῶντες καὶ διψῶντες τὴν δικαιοσύνην (hoi peinōntes kai dipsōntes tēn dikaiosunēn)
- πεινάω (peinaō) = to be hungry, famished
- διψάω (dipsaō) = to be thirsty, parched
- δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosunē) = righteousness, justice, right-standing before God

```
THE FOURTH BEATITUDE: HUNGER FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
│
├─ HUNGER/THIRST ≠ mild preference
│   │
│   └─ Life-or-death desperation
│       │
│       ├─ NOT: "I'd like some righteousness if convenient"
│       └─ BUT: "I'm starving for it, dying of thirst for it"
│
├─ RIGHTEOUSNESS = Two dimensions
│   │
│   ├─ Personal: Right standing before God (justification)
│   └─ Social: Justice, things made right (shalom)
│
└─► "for they shall be satisfied"
    │
    ├─ χορτασθήσονται (chortasthēsontai) = "filled to satisfaction"
    ├─ Future tense: eschatological fullness
    └─ Present reality: taste now, feast later
        │
        PARADOX: The hungry are filled; the satisfied stay empty
```

**One-Line**: Those desperate for righteousness like a starving person for bread will be completely satisfied.

#### 5. Blessed are the merciful (v. 7)

**Greek**: οἱ ἐλεήμονες (hoi eleēmones)
- ἐλεήμων (eleēmōn) = merciful, compassionate, showing active kindness

```
THE FIFTH BEATITUDE: MERCY
│
├─ MERCY ≠ mere feeling
│   │
│   ├─ NOT: "I feel bad for them"
│   └─ BUT: "I actively help them, at cost to myself"
│
├─ THE MERCY PATTERN:
│   │
│   └─ God's mercy → My mercy → God's mercy (continued)
│       │
│       ├─ I've received infinite mercy (vertical)
│       ├─ I now show mercy to others (horizontal)
│       └─ I continue to need and receive mercy (vertical)
│
└─► "for they shall receive mercy"
    │
    ├─ Future tense: final judgment
    ├─ Present reality: ongoing need
    │
    PARADOX: The merciful need mercy (and get it)
```

**Warning Connection**: Matthew 18:23-35 - The unforgiving servant

**One-Line**: Those who show mercy prove they've received it and will continue to receive it.

#### 6. Blessed are the pure in heart (v. 8)

**Greek**: οἱ καθαροὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ (hoi katharoi tē kardia)
- καθαρός (katharos) = clean, pure, uncontaminated
- καρδία (kardia) = heart, the center of thought, will, and emotion

```
THE SIXTH BEATITUDE: PURITY OF HEART
│
├─ HEART = Control center
│   │
│   ├─ NOT: Just emotions
│   ├─ NOT: Just thoughts
│   │
│   └─ BUT: The whole inner person - motives, desires, will
│
├─ PURE HEART ≠ Sinless perfection
│   │
│   ├─ NOT: Never struggle with sin
│   │
│   └─ BUT: Undivided loyalty, single focus
│       │
│       ├─ James 4:8 - "purify your hearts, you double-minded"
│       └─ NOT: Playing both sides, one foot in kingdom, one in world
│
└─► "for they shall see God"
    │
    ├─ ὄψονται τὸν θεόν (opsontai ton theon) = "they will see God"
    ├─ Now: Spiritual sight, knowing God
    ├─ Then: Face-to-face vision (1 Cor 13:12)
    │
    PARADOX: Only the pure see the Holy One
```

**Cross-Reference**: Psalm 24:3-4 - "Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? He who has clean hands and a pure heart"

**One-Line**: Only the single-hearted will see God - nothing can coexist with double vision.

#### 7. Blessed are the peacemakers (v. 9)

**Greek**: οἱ εἰρηνοποιοί (hoi eirēnopoioi)
- εἰρηνοποιός (eirēnopoios) = peacemaker (εἰρήνη = peace + ποιέω = make)

```
THE SEVENTH BEATITUDE: PEACEMAKING
│
├─ PEACEMAKER ≠ Peacekeeper
│   │
│   ├─ Peacekeeper: Avoids conflict, sweeps under rug
│   └─ Peacemaker: Actively pursues reconciliation at cost
│
├─ PEACE (εἰρήνη / eirēnē) = שָׁלוֹם (shalom)
│   │
│   ├─ NOT: Absence of conflict
│   ├─ NOT: Quiet comfort
│   │
│   └─ BUT: Complete wholeness, right relationships restored
│       │
│       ├─ Peace with God (vertical)
│       ├─ Peace with others (horizontal)
│       └─ Peace within self (internal)
│
└─► "for they shall be called sons of God"
    │
    ├─ WHY? Because God is a peacemaker
    │   │
    │   └─ 2 Cor 5:18-19 - "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself"
    │
    ├─ Sons RESEMBLE their Father
    │   │
    │   └─ "Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (5:48)
    │
    PARADOX: Peacemakers start wars (against division, hatred, evil)
```

**One-Line**: Those who make peace prove whose children they are - the Father reconciled enemies at infinite cost.

#### 8. Blessed are those persecuted for righteousness (v. 10)

**Greek**: οἱ δεδιωγμένοι ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης (hoi dediōgmenoi heneken dikaiosunēs)
- διώκω (diōkō) = to pursue, persecute, chase down
- ἕνεκεν (heneken) = for the sake of, because of

```
THE EIGHTH BEATITUDE: PERSECUTION
│
├─ NOT: Any suffering
│   │
│   ├─ NOT: Persecution for being obnoxious
│   ├─ NOT: Suffering from own bad choices
│   │
│   └─ BUT: "for righteousness' sake" → because of kingdom values
│
├─ THE PERSECUTION QUESTION:
│   │
│   └─ If no one opposes you, are you actually living for the kingdom?
│       │
│       ├─ John 15:18-19 - "If world hates you, know it hated me first"
│       └─ 2 Tim 3:12 - "All who desire to live godly will be persecuted"
│
└─► "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven"
    │
    ├─ SAME PROMISE as beatitude 1 (bookends)
    ├─ Full circle: Poor in spirit → Persecuted for righteousness
    │
    PARADOX: The persecuted possess the kingdom
```

**One-Line**: If living for the kingdom costs you nothing, you might not be living for the kingdom.

#### 9. Expansion: Persecution for Jesus specifically (vv. 11-12)

```
v. 10: Persecuted for righteousness (general)
    │
    └─► v. 11-12: Persecuted for JESUS (specific, personal)
        │
        ├─ "on my account" (v. 11)
        ├─ Insult, persecute, slander (v. 11)
        │
        └─► Response: REJOICE and be GLAD (v. 12)
            │
            ├─ WHY? Great reward in heaven
            ├─ WHO? Same treatment as the prophets
            │
            └─ The prophets suffered - so will Jesus' followers
```

### The Beatitudes' Structure

```
MOVEMENT 1-4: POVERTY → RECEPTIVITY
│
├─ Poor in spirit (v. 3)      → Empty hands
├─ Mourn (v. 4)                → Broken heart
├─ Meek (v. 5)                 → Open posture
└─ Hunger/thirst (v. 6)        → Desperate need
    │
    └─► RECEIVE the kingdom

MOVEMENT 5-8: GIVING → ACTIVITY
│
├─ Merciful (v. 7)             → Give mercy
├─ Pure in heart (v. 8)        → Give undivided loyalty
├─ Peacemakers (v. 9)          → Give reconciliation
└─ Persecuted (v. 10)          → Give up safety/comfort
    │
    └─► LIVE OUT the kingdom
```

**One-Line for Beatitudes**: The kingdom turns the world upside-down - the blessed are the broken, hungry, merciful, and hated.

---

## Movement 3: Salt and Light (vv. 13-16)

### The Shift: From "Blessed ARE" to "You ARE"

```
BEATITUDES (vv. 3-12)          SALT & LIGHT (vv. 13-16)
│                               │
├─ Descriptive                  ├─ Declarative identity
├─ "Blessed are..."             ├─ "You ARE..."
├─ Who enters kingdom           ├─ What kingdom citizens do
│                               │
└─ CHARACTER                    └─ FUNCTION
```

### Salt (v. 13)

**Greek**: Ὑμεῖς ἐστε τὸ ἅλας τῆς γῆς (Hymeis este to halas tēs gēs)
- ἅλας (halas) = salt

```
YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
│
├─ SALT'S FUNCTIONS:
│   │
│   ├─ PRESERVES → Prevents decay, corruption
│   ├─ FLAVORS → Makes food taste good
│   ├─ PENETRATES → Gets into the meat
│   └─ PURIFIES → Used in sacrifices, covenants
│
├─ THE WARNING: Salt losing saltiness
│   │
│   ├─ ἐὰν... μωρανθῇ (ean... mōranthē) = "if it becomes foolish/insipid"
│   ├─ Chemically impossible for NaCl to lose saltiness
│   ├─ BUT: Contaminated salt (mixed with other minerals) becomes useless
│   │
│   └─► If you lose your distinctiveness, you're worthless
│       │
│       ├─ Thrown out
│       └─ Trampled underfoot
│
└─ THE POINT: You don't BECOME salt, you ARE salt
    │
    └─► So act like it, or become useless
```

**One-Line**: You are salt - don't lose what makes you different or you'll be discarded as worthless.

### Light (vv. 14-16)

**Greek**: Ὑμεῖς ἐστε τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου (Hymeis este to phōs tou kosmou)
- φῶς (phōs) = light
- κόσμος (kosmos) = world, ordered system

```
YOU ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
│
├─ LIGHT'S NATURE:
│   │
│   ├─ REVEALS → Exposes what's hidden
│   ├─ GUIDES → Shows the way
│   ├─ WARNS → Shows dangers
│   └─ ATTRACTS → Draws people
│
├─ TWO IMAGES:
│   │
│   ├─ City on a hill (v. 14b)
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Cannot be hidden
│   │   └─ Visible to all
│   │
│   └─ Lamp on a stand (v. 15)
│       │
│       ├─ NOT under a basket (μόδιον / modion - grain measure)
│       └─ ON a lampstand → gives light to ALL in house
│
├─ THE COMMAND: "Let your light shine" (v. 16)
│   │
│   ├─ λαμψάτω τὸ φῶς ὑμῶν (lampsatō to phōs hymōn)
│   ├─ NOT: "Try to shine" or "Work hard to shine"
│   └─ BUT: "Let it shine" → Don't hide what you already are
│
└─► PURPOSE: "That they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven"
    │
    ├─ NOT: "Look how great I am!"
    ├─ BUT: "Look how great GOD is!"
    │
    └─ Good works point PAST you to the Father
```

**Diagnostic**: Is your light hidden?
- Do you hide your faith at work, school, home?
- Do you compartmentalize - "Christian on Sunday, normal rest of week"?
- Are you indistinguishable from non-Christians in your values, speech, priorities?

**One-Line**: You are light - don't hide it under a basket, but let it shine so others see God, not you.

---

## Movement 4: Fulfilling the Law (vv. 17-20)

### The Transition

After declaring WHO the kingdom citizens are (Beatitudes) and WHAT they are (Salt & Light), Jesus now addresses THE STANDARD: What about the Law?

### Not Abolishing but Fulfilling (vv. 17-18)

**Greek Key Terms**:
- καταλῦσαι (katalusai) = to abolish, destroy, tear down
- πληρῶσαι (plērōsai) = to fulfill, complete, bring to full expression
- ἰῶτα (iōta) = yod (י), smallest Hebrew letter
- κεραία (keraia) = serif, tiny stroke distinguishing letters

```
THE LAW'S DESTINY
│
├─ v. 17: "Do not think I came to ABOLISH the Law or Prophets"
│   │
│   ├─ Μὴ νομίσητε (Mē nomisēte) = "Don't suppose, don't assume"
│   ├─ Why clarify? Because Jesus seems to be breaking the Law
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Healing on Sabbath
│   │   ├─ Touching lepers
│   │   ├─ Eating with sinners
│   │   └─ Claiming authority over Temple
│   │
│   └─► "I did not come to abolish but to FULFILL"
│       │
│       ├─ NOT: Relaxing the Law
│       ├─ NOT: Making it easier
│       │
│       └─ BUT: Bringing it to full expression, completion
│
├─ v. 18: "Truly I say to you..."
│   │
│   ├─ ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν (amēn legō hymin) → Solemn, authoritative pronouncement
│   │
│   └─► "Until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law"
│       │
│       ├─ The Law stands UNTIL "all is accomplished"
│       ├─ Jesus doesn't delete - He completes
│       │
│       └─ Matthew 27:51 - Curtain torn → Access granted → Law fulfilled in Christ
│
└─ THE FULFILLMENT PATTERN:
    │
    ├─ TYPOLOGY: Passover lamb → Christ our Passover (1 Cor 5:7)
    ├─ PROPHECY: Virgin birth → Isaiah 7:14
    ├─ MORAL: "Love neighbor" → Extended to "Love enemies" (v. 43-48)
    │
    └─► Jesus doesn't lower the bar - He IS the bar
```

**Cross-Reference**:
- Romans 10:4 - "Christ is the end [τέλος / telos = goal, fulfillment] of the law for righteousness"
- Galatians 3:24 - "The law was our guardian until Christ came"

### Exceeding the Scribes and Pharisees (vv. 19-20)

```
v. 19: "Whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments..."
│
├─ λύσῃ (lysē) = "loosen, relax, break"
├─ Two categories:
│   │
│   ├─ Break + teach others to break → "least in kingdom"
│   └─ Do + teach → "great in kingdom"
│
└─► Obedience AND teaching matters

v. 20: "Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees..."
│
├─ περισσεύσῃ πλεῖον (perisseusē pleion) = "surpasses, goes beyond, exceeds"
│
├─ THE SHOCK: Pharisees were the MOST righteous people
│   │
│   ├─ Tithed mint, dill, cumin (Matt 23:23)
│   ├─ Fasted twice a week
│   ├─ Prayed publicly
│   ├─ Memorized Torah
│   │
│   └─► Yet... "you will never enter the kingdom of heaven"
│
└─► HOW can we exceed them?
    │
    ├─ NOT: More rules, more effort
    ├─ NOT: External performance
    │
    └─ BUT: INTERNAL transformation
        │
        ├─ Pharisees: Whitewashed tombs (Matt 23:27)
        ├─ Jesus: Clean the INSIDE of the cup (Matt 23:26)
        │
        └─ The six antitheses (vv. 21-48) show HOW
```

**Diagnostic**:
- Are you focused on external compliance or heart transformation?
- Do you obey the "letter" while violating the "spirit"?
- Is your righteousness self-generated or Christ-given?

**One-Line**: Jesus doesn't lower the Law's bar - He raises it impossibly high to drive you to grace.

---

## Movement 5: Six Antitheses (vv. 21-48)

### The Pattern

```
THE ANTITHESIS STRUCTURE (repeated 6 times)
│
├─ "You have heard that it was said..." (ἠκούσατε ὅτι ἐρρέθη)
│   │
│   └─ The traditional interpretation, the external command
│
└─ "But I say to you..." (ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν)
    │
    ├─ Jesus' authoritative reinterpretation
    ├─ NOT: Contradicting the Law
    └─ BUT: Revealing the Law's true DEPTH and INTENT
```

**The Trajectory**: EXTERNAL → INTERNAL

### Antithesis 1: Murder → Anger (vv. 21-26)

#### The Command (v. 21)

```
TRADITIONAL: "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13)
│
├─ φονεύσεις (phoneuseis) = murder, kill
├─ External act only
└─ "Whoever murders shall be liable to judgment"
    │
    └─ Court system handles it
```

#### Jesus' Intensification (vv. 22-26)

```
JESUS: "But I say to you..."
│
├─ v. 22a: "Everyone who is ANGRY with his brother shall be liable to judgment"
│   │
│   ├─ ὀργιζόμενος (orgizomenos) = being angry, harboring wrath
│   ├─ NOT: Righteous anger (Mark 3:5)
│   └─ BUT: Nursed, cherished anger = murder seed
│
├─ v. 22b: "Whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council"
│   │
│   ├─ ῥακά (rhaka) = "empty-headed, worthless" (Aramaic insult)
│   └─ Verbal expression of contempt
│
├─ v. 22c: "Whoever says 'You fool!' shall be liable to the hell of fire"
│   │
│   ├─ μωρός (mōros) = fool, godless person
│   ├─ γέενναν τοῦ πυρός (geennan tou pyros) = Gehenna of fire
│   │
│   └─► ESCALATION: Judgment → Council → Hell
│       │
│       └─ The progression shows the SERIOUSNESS of heart-anger
│
└─ vv. 23-26: TWO APPLICATIONS
    │
    ├─ vv. 23-24: If your brother has something against you
    │   │
    │   ├─ SETTING: At the altar, about to offer sacrifice
    │   ├─ COMMAND: "Leave your gift... first be reconciled"
    │   │
    │   └─► Reconciliation > Religious ritual
    │       │
    │       └─ Horizontal relationships affect vertical relationship
    │
    └─ vv. 25-26: Settle with your accuser quickly
        │
        ├─ "Make friends quickly with your accuser"
        ├─ Prison imagery: "You will never get out until you paid the last penny"
        │
        └─► Urgency - unresolved conflict has consequences
```

**The Core Insight**:
```
MURDER pathway:
│
Anger (heart) → Contempt (mouth) → Violence (hand) → Murder (act)
    │
    └─► Jesus addresses the ROOT, not just the fruit
```

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Who are you angry with right now?
- Have you written someone off as "worthless" in your heart?
- Is there broken relationship you're avoiding dealing with?
- Are you offering worship while harboring bitterness?

**One-Line**: Murder begins in the heart with anger - kill the root or it will produce the fruit.

### Antithesis 2: Adultery → Lust (vv. 27-30)

#### The Command (v. 27)

```
TRADITIONAL: "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14)
│
├─ μοιχεύσεις (moicheuseis) = commit adultery
├─ External act: Sexual intercourse outside marriage covenant
└─ Addressees: Married persons (primarily men in cultural context)
```

#### Jesus' Intensification (vv. 28-30)

```
JESUS: "But I say to you..." (v. 28)
│
└─► "Everyone who LOOKS at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart"
    │
    ├─ βλέπων (blepōn) = looking, gazing (present participle - ongoing action)
    ├─ πρὸς τὸ ἐπιθυμῆσαι (pros to epithymēsai) = "in order to lust" (purpose clause)
    │   │
    │   └─ NOT: Involuntary attraction
    │   └─ BUT: Deliberate cultivation of lustful desire
    │
    ├─ ἐμοίχευσεν (emoicheusen) = "has committed adultery" (aorist - completed action)
    ├─ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ (en tē kardia autou) = "in his heart"
    │
    └─► The LOOK with INTENT = The ACT in God's eyes
```

**The Radical Surgery (vv. 29-30)**:

```
THE EYE (v. 29)                          THE HAND (v. 30)
│                                        │
"If your right eye causes you to sin"   "If your right hand causes you to sin"
│                                        │
├─ σκανδαλίζει (skandalizei) = causes   ├─ Same verb: σκανδαλίζει
│   to stumble, traps, ensnares          │
│                                        │
└─► "Tear it out and throw it away"     └─► "Cut it off and throw it away"
    │                                        │
    ├─ ἔξελε (exele) = gouge out            ├─ ἔκκοψον (ekkopson) = cut off
    ├─ βάλε (bale) = throw away             ├─ βάλε (bale) = throw away
    │                                        │
    └─ WHY? "Better to lose one member      └─ Same logic
        than your whole body go to hell"
```

**Interpretation**:

```
IS JESUS COMMANDING SELF-MUTILATION?
│
├─ NO - Physical mutilation doesn't cure heart lust
│   │
│   ├─ Blind man can still lust
│   └─ One-handed man can still sin
│
└─ YES - Radical amputation of sin sources
    │
    ├─ PRINCIPLE: Whatever leads you to sin MUST GO
    │
    ├─ EXAMPLES:
    │   │
    │   ├─ Internet access without accountability?
    │   ├─ Certain friendships?
    │   ├─ Entertainment choices?
    │   ├─ Places you go, routes you take?
    │   │
    │   └─► Cut it off, gouge it out, throw it away
    │
    └─► Better to live maimed than damned
```

**The Seriousness**:
- γέενναν (geennan) - Gehenna, hell - mentioned twice (vv. 29-30)
- Jesus takes sexual sin with UTMOST seriousness
- The stakes: Eternal destruction

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Where do your eyes linger?
- What "right eye" or "right hand" do you need to cut off?
- Are you willing to make drastic changes to pursue purity?
- Do you minimize lust as "not that bad - at least I didn't actually..."?

**One-Line**: The eye that lingers has already betrayed - cut off whatever leads to sin before sin cuts you off.

### Antithesis 3: Divorce → Covenant (vv. 31-32)

#### The Traditional Teaching (v. 31)

```
TRADITIONAL: "Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce" (Deut 24:1-4)
│
├─ ἀποστάσιον (apostasion) = certificate of divorce, bill of dismissal
├─ Rabbinic debate: What grounds for divorce?
│   │
│   ├─ Hillel school: Any reason (burned dinner, found someone prettier)
│   └─ Shammai school: Only adultery
│
└─ FOCUS: On the PROCEDURE (certificate) not the ACT
```

#### Jesus' Tightening (v. 32)

```
JESUS: "But I say to you..."
│
└─► "Everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality..."
    │
    ├─ ἀπολύων (apolyōn) = divorcing, sending away
    ├─ παρεκτὸς λόγου πορνείας (parektos logou porneias) = "except for sexual immorality"
    │   │
    │   ├─ πορνεία (porneia) = sexual immorality, fornication
    │   └─ Exception clause (debated: betrothal unfaithfulness? ongoing adultery?)
    │
    ├─ "...makes her commit adultery"
    │   │
    │   └─ ποιεῖ αὐτὴν μοιχευθῆναι (poiei autēn moicheuthēnai)
    │       │
    │       ├─ In that culture, divorced woman forced to remarry for survival
    │       └─ Husband's action leads to her "adultery" (remarriage)
    │
    └─ "...and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery"
        │
        └─► Serious view of marriage covenant
```

**The Core Principle**:

```
MARRIAGE COVENANT
│
├─ Genesis 2:24 - "The two shall become one flesh"
├─ NOT: A contract (negotiable, breakable)
├─ BUT: A covenant (permanent, sacred)
│
└─► Divorce is NOT God's design
    │
    ├─ Malachi 2:16 - "I hate divorce, says the LORD"
    ├─ Matthew 19:8 - "Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed divorce"
    │
    └─ Jesus restores CREATION intent, not Mosaic concession
```

**Cross-Reference**: Matthew 19:3-12 - Extended teaching on divorce

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Do you view marriage as covenant or contract?
- Are you protecting your marriage or looking for exit strategies?
- Do you honor others' marriages or encourage "you deserve better"?

**One-Line**: Marriage is a covenant, not a contract - Jesus won't let you reduce it to paperwork.

### Antithesis 4: Oaths → Truthfulness (vv. 33-37)

#### The Traditional Teaching (v. 33)

```
TRADITIONAL: "You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn"
│
├─ Multiple OT passages:
│   │
│   ├─ Leviticus 19:12 - "You shall not swear by my name falsely"
│   ├─ Numbers 30:2 - "If a man vows... he shall not break his word"
│   └─ Deuteronomy 23:21 - "If you make a vow... you shall not delay fulfilling it"
│
└─ FOCUS: Don't break oaths you make
```

#### Jesus' Radical Shift (vv. 34-37)

```
JESUS: "But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all" (v. 34a)
│
├─ μὴ ὀμόσαι ὅλως (mē omosai holōs) = "not swear at all"
│
├─ WHY? Four examples (vv. 34b-36):
│   │
│   ├─ v. 34b: NOT by heaven → "it is the throne of God"
│   ├─ v. 35a: NOT by earth → "it is his footstool"
│   ├─ v. 35b: NOT by Jerusalem → "it is the city of the great King"
│   └─ v. 36: NOT by your own head → "you cannot make one hair white or black"
│       │
│       └─► You have NOTHING that's truly yours to swear by
│           │
│           └─ Everything belongs to God - you can't leverage what's not yours
│
└─ v. 37: THE ALTERNATIVE
    │
    ├─ "Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'"
    │   │
    │   ├─ ἔστω... ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναὶ τὸ οὒ οὔ (estō... hymōn to nai nai to ou ou)
    │   └─ Plain speech, simple truth
    │
    └─► "Anything more than this comes from evil"
        │
        ├─ ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ (ek tou ponērou) = "from the evil one" or "from evil"
        │
        └─ WHY is swearing evil?
            │
            ├─ Implies: "I'm usually lying, but THIS time I'm telling truth"
            └─ Creates two-tier system: Oath-backed vs. regular speech
```

**The Principle**:

```
THE TRUTHFULNESS REQUIREMENT
│
├─ Pharisaic system: Swearing hierarchy
│   │
│   ├─ Swear by Temple? Not binding
│   ├─ Swear by gold of Temple? Binding (Matt 23:16-22)
│   │
│   └─► Casuistry: How to lie while technically keeping oaths
│
└─ JESUS: Your word should need NO oath
    │
    ├─ Be SO truthful that Yes = Yes, No = No
    ├─ NO need for "I swear!" or "I promise!"
    │
    └─► Character of INTEGRITY, not just legally binding words
```

**Application**:
- Do you exaggerate, spin, shade the truth?
- Do you say "I promise" because people don't trust your word?
- Are you truthful in small things (not just when under oath)?

**One-Line**: If you need an oath to be believed, your word is already worthless - let yes mean yes.

### Antithesis 5: Retaliation → Absorption (vv. 38-42)

#### The Traditional Teaching (v. 38)

```
TRADITIONAL: "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" (Exodus 21:24; Lev 24:20; Deut 19:21)
│
├─ ὀφθαλμὸν ἀντὶ ὀφθαλμοῦ (ophthalmon anti ophthalmou)
├─ καὶ ὀδόντα ἀντὶ ὀδόντος (kai odonta anti odontos)
│
├─ ORIGINAL PURPOSE: LIMIT vengeance
│   │
│   ├─ NOT: "Get revenge!"
│   └─ BUT: "Don't escalate" - proportional justice only
│       │
│       └─ Genesis 4:23-24 - Lamech: "I have killed a man for wounding me"
│           │
│           └─ Lex talionis LIMITS this tendency
│
└─ USED BY: Courts, not personal vengeance
```

#### Jesus' Non-Retaliation (vv. 39-42)

```
JESUS: "But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil" (v. 39a)
│
├─ μὴ ἀντιστῆναι τῷ πονηρῷ (mē antistēnai tō ponērō)
│   │
│   ├─ ἀντιστῆναι (antistēnai) = "to resist, oppose, stand against"
│   └─ τῷ πονηρῷ (tō ponērō) = "the evil one" or "the evil person"
│
├─ NOT: Passive doormat theology
├─ NOT: No justice system or self-defense
│
└─ BUT: Personal willingness to ABSORB wrong rather than RETALIATE
    │
    └─► FOUR EXAMPLES of non-retaliation:
```

**Example 1: Slap on right cheek (v. 39b)**

```
"If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also"
│
├─ ῥαπίζει (rhapizei) = strikes with open hand (slap, not punch)
├─ Right cheek = Backhanded slap
│   │
│   └─ INSULT more than injury
│       │
│       ├─ Master to slave
│       ├─ Superior to inferior
│       └─ Intentional humiliation
│
└─► Turn the other cheek = Refuse to retaliate for INSULT
    │
    └─ Absorb the dishonor, refuse the revenge
```

**Example 2: Sued for tunic (v. 40)**

```
"If anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well"
│
├─ χιτῶνα (chitōna) = tunic (undergarment)
├─ ἱμάτιον (himation) = cloak (outer garment)
│
├─ Legal context: Being sued in court
│   │
│   └─ Exodus 22:26-27 - Cloak must be returned by night (protection, warmth)
│
└─► Give MORE than demanded
    │
    └─ Generosity beyond legal requirement
```

**Example 3: Compelled to go one mile (v. 41)**

```
"If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles"
│
├─ ἀγγαρεύσει (angareusei) = compel, impress into service
│   │
│   ├─ Persian loan word: Royal courier system
│   └─ Roman soldiers could compel civilians to carry gear for 1 mile
│
└─► Go the SECOND mile voluntarily
    │
    ├─ First mile: Compulsion, slavery, resentment
    ├─ Second mile: Choice, freedom, generosity
    │
    └─ Surprise your oppressor with grace
```

**Example 4: Give to those who beg/borrow (v. 42)**

```
"Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you"
│
├─ τῷ αἰτοῦντί σε δός (tō aitounti se dos) = "to the one asking you, give"
├─ μὴ ἀποστραφῇς (mē apostraphēs) = "don't turn away"
│
└─► Generosity to those in need
    │
    ├─ Begging: Immediate need
    ├─ Borrowing: Planned need
    │
    └─ Respond with open-handed giving
```

**The Principle**:

```
THE NON-RETALIATION PATTERN
│
├─ NOT: Justice is wrong (God will judge - Rom 12:19)
├─ NOT: Never defend others (protect the vulnerable)
│
└─ BUT: Personal willingness to absorb wrong
    │
    ├─ For INSULT → Turn other cheek
    ├─ For LEGAL ACTION → Give more than asked
    ├─ For OPPRESSION → Go extra mile
    ├─ For NEED → Give generously
    │
    └─► OUTCOME: Evil is overcome with GOOD (Rom 12:21)
```

**The Model**:
- 1 Peter 2:23 - "When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly"

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- What's your first reaction when insulted or wronged?
- Do you demand your rights or absorb wrongs for the gospel?
- Are you generous or calculating with your resources?

**One-Line**: The world escalates - kingdom citizens absorb, surprise, and overcome evil with unexpected generosity.

### Antithesis 6: Neighbor → Enemy Love (vv. 43-48)

#### The Traditional Teaching (v. 43)

```
TRADITIONAL: "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy"
│
├─ "Love your neighbor" = Leviticus 19:18 (Scripture)
│   │
│   └─ ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου (agapēseis ton plēsion sou)
│
└─ "Hate your enemy" = Rabbinic addition (NOT Scripture)
    │
    ├─ Psalms of imprecation (Ps 139:21-22)
    ├─ Qumran community: "Love the sons of light, hate the sons of darkness"
    │
    └─► Definition game: Who is my "neighbor"?
        │
        └─ Luke 10:29 - Lawyer asks Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"
```

#### Jesus' Radical Love (vv. 44-48)

```
JESUS: "But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (v. 44)
│
├─ ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν (agapate tous echthrous hymōn) = "love your enemies"
│   │
│   ├─ ἀγαπάω (agapaō) = covenant love, active willing of good
│   ├─ NOT: Warm feelings (that's φιλέω / phileō)
│   └─ BUT: Deliberate choice to seek their good
│
└─ προσεύχεσθε ὑπὲρ τῶν διωκόντων ὑμᾶς (proseuchesthe hyper tōn diōkontōn hymas)
    │
    └─ "Pray for those who persecute you"
        │
        ├─ Active intercession
        └─ Seeking God's blessing on those who harm you
```

**The Reason (vv. 45-47)**:

```
v. 45: "So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven"
│
├─ ὅπως γένησθε υἱοὶ τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν (hopōs genēsthe huioi tou patros hymōn)
│   │
│   └─ Purpose clause: "in order that you may be sons"
│       │
│       ├─ NOT: "so you become His children" (already are)
│       └─ BUT: "so you SHOW whose children you are"
│
└─► Evidence: "For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good"
    │
    ├─ τὸν ἥλιον αὐτοῦ ἀνατέλλει (ton hēlion autou anatellei)
    ├─ Rain falls on just and unjust (v. 45b)
    │
    └─► God's INDISCRIMINATE blessing
        │
        ├─ Doesn't wait for people to deserve it
        └─ Common grace to ALL

v. 46-47: THE CONTRAST
│
├─ v. 46: "If you love those who love you, what reward do you have?"
│   │
│   ├─ τίνα μισθὸν ἔχετε; (tina misthon echete?)
│   └─► Even tax collectors do that!
│       │
│       └─ Tax collectors = Traitors, lowest moral category
│
└─ v. 47: "If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others?"
    │
    ├─ ἀσπάσησθε (aspasēsthe) = greet, welcome, show hospitality
    └─► Even Gentiles do that!
        │
        └─ Gentiles = Outside covenant, no special revelation
            │
            └─ IF you only love the lovable, you're NO DIFFERENT than pagans
```

**The Command: Be Perfect (v. 48)**

```
"You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect"
│
├─ Ἔσεσθε οὖν ὑμεῖς τέλειοι (Esesthe oun hymeis teleioi)
│   │
│   └─ τέλειος (teleios) = perfect, complete, mature, whole
│       │
│       ├─ NOT: Sinless perfection (impossible)
│       ├─ NOT: Moral flawlessness
│       │
│       └─ BUT: Complete, undivided, whole-hearted love
│           │
│           ├─ LIKE God: Loves enemies, blesses persecutors
│           └─ NOT selective love (friends only) but COMPLETE love (even enemies)
│
├─ ὡς ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος τέλειός ἐστιν (hōs ho patēr hymōn ho ouranios teleios estin)
│   │
│   └─ "as your heavenly Father is perfect"
│       │
│       └─► The STANDARD: God's own character
│
└─► PARALLEL: Luke 6:36 - "Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful"
    │
    └─ Perfect = Merciful, complete in love
```

**The Principle**:

```
ENEMY LOVE
│
├─ WHO is an enemy?
│   │
│   ├─ Those who hate you
│   ├─ Those who persecute you
│   ├─ Those who wrong you
│   └─ Those who oppose you
│
├─ HOW to love them?
│   │
│   ├─ Actively will their good
│   ├─ Pray for them (v. 44)
│   ├─ Bless them (Luke 6:28)
│   ├─ Do good to them (Luke 6:27)
│   │
│   └─► NOT passive tolerance but ACTIVE love
│
└─► WHY?
    │
    ├─ Because God loved YOU while you were His enemy (Rom 5:8, 10)
    ├─ To show whose children you are (v. 45)
    └─ To be DIFFERENT from the world (vv. 46-47)
        │
        └─ The world loves friends, hates enemies
            │
            └─ Kingdom citizens love BOTH
```

**The Model**:
- Jesus on the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34)
- Stephen: "Lord, do not hold this sin against them" (Acts 7:60)

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Who are YOUR enemies (personal, political, spiritual)?
- Are you praying for them or cursing them?
- Do you treat opponents with dignity or demonize them?
- Is your love selective (only those who love you back)?

**One-Line**: To love only the lovable requires nothing - to love enemies proves whose child you are.

## Unified Framework

```
MATTHEW 5: THE KING'S MANIFESTO
│
THE STRUCTURE:
│
├─ BEATITUDES (vv. 3-12): Who is BLESSED?
│   │
│   └─► The kingdom inverts the world's values
│       │
│       └─ Blessed: poor, mourning, meek, hungry, merciful, pure, peacemakers, persecuted
│
├─ SALT & LIGHT (vv. 13-16): Who ARE you?
│   │
│   └─► Identity PRECEDES function
│       │
│       └─ You ARE salt/light → So act like it
│
├─ FULFILLING LAW (vv. 17-20): What STANDARD?
│   │
│   └─► Jesus doesn't abolish but FULFILLS
│       │
│       ├─ Not lowering the bar
│       └─ Exceeding the Pharisees = INTERNAL not just external
│
└─ SIX ANTITHESES (vv. 21-48): How DEEP?
    │
    └─► From EXTERNAL to INTERNAL
        │
        ├─ Not murder → Not hate
        ├─ Not adultery → Not lust
        ├─ Proper divorce → Honor covenant
        ├─ Keep oaths → Be truthful
        ├─ Limited revenge → Absorb wrong
        └─ Love neighbor → Love enemy
            │
            └─► TRAJECTORY: Heart transformation, not just behavior modification

THE THESIS:
│
└─► Jesus reveals what the Law always demanded: PERFECT LOVE
    │
    ├─ Love God with all your heart (Deut 6:5)
    ├─ Love neighbor as yourself (Lev 19:18)
    ├─ Love even enemies (Matt 5:44)
    │
    └─► NO ONE can meet this standard
        │
        ├─ The Law drives us to DESPAIR of self-righteousness
        └─ The Law drives us to DEPENDENCE on Christ
            │
            └─ Only HE lived Matthew 5 perfectly
                │
                └─ We live it BY Him, THROUGH Him, IN Him
```

### The Impossible Standard

```
THE SERMON'S FUNCTION
│
├─ NOT: Ladder to climb ("Try harder!")
├─ NOT: New law to earn salvation
│
└─ BUT: MIRROR showing our need
    │
    ├─ WHO can be poor in spirit, mourn, meek, hungry, merciful, pure, peacemaking, AND persecuted?
    ├─ WHO can be salt that never loses flavor and light that never dims?
    ├─ WHO can exceed the most righteous people (Pharisees)?
    ├─ WHO never hates, never lusts, never lies, never retaliates, loves enemies perfectly?
    │
    └─► ONLY JESUS
        │
        ├─ He lived the Sermon perfectly
        ├─ He fulfilled the Law completely
        ├─ He loved perfectly, even enemies (the cross)
        │
        └─► Two responses:
            │
            ├─ DESPAIR: "I can't do this!"
            │   │
            │   └─► CORRECT → Run to Christ
            │
            └─ SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS: "I'm doing pretty well!"
                │
                └─► WRONG → You've missed the point
```

## Personal Notes

### The Beatitudes: Upside-Down Kingdom

The Beatitudes aren't a ladder to climb. They're a description of what kingdom citizens look like - and it's SHOCKING. The world says blessed are the rich, happy, powerful, popular. Jesus says blessed are the OPPOSITE.

This should:
1. **Comfort the afflicted**: If you're poor in spirit, mourning, persecuted → You're in the kingdom
2. **Afflict the comfortable**: If you're self-satisfied, entertainment-seeking, power-grasping → Check yourself

I keep trying to read the Beatitudes as "do these things to get blessed." But they're more like "if you're broken/hungry/persecuted, you're ALREADY blessed because you're in the kingdom." The kingdom doesn't go to those who have it together - it goes to those who know they DON'T.

### Salt & Light: Identity Before Activity

"You ARE salt... you ARE light."

NOT: "Try to become..."
NOT: "Work hard to be..."

Identity is GIVEN. Function flows from it.

The warning: Salt that loses saltiness is worthless. If I'm indistinguishable from the world - same entertainment, same values, same speech, same priorities - I've lost my function. God will "throw me out and trample me underfoot."

That's terrifying. And needed.

Where am I hiding my light? Work? School? Family? Online?

### The Law: Fulfilled Not Abolished

Jesus doesn't make the Law EASIER. He makes it HARDER - impossibly hard.

"Don't murder" → "Don't hate"
"Don't commit adultery" → "Don't lust"

The Pharisees could keep the external commands (barely). But NO ONE can keep the internal standard.

The Law's purpose: Drive me to Christ.

I can't do this. I fail on every count. I've murdered in my heart, committed adultery in my eyes, lied, retaliated, hated enemies.

But Jesus DID this. Perfectly. And He offers His righteousness to me.

Romans 8:3-4 - "What the Law, weakened by the flesh, could not do, God did by sending his own Son... in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us."

### Anger: The Root of Murder

I don't murder people. But I hate. I harbor bitterness. I write people off as worthless.

Jesus says: That's murder in seed form.

The diagnostic: "If you remember your brother has something against you... leave your gift... first be reconciled."

Reconciliation > Religious activity.

How many times have I gone to church, sung worship songs, prayed - while nursing anger toward someone?

Jesus says: STOP. Go make it right. THEN come back.

### Lust: Gouge It Out

"If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out."

This isn't about literal self-mutilation. It's about RADICAL amputation of sin sources.

What needs to go?
- Phone apps?
- Internet access?
- Certain routes I drive?
- Certain friendships?
- Certain shows/movies?

Better to live "maimed" than damned.

The problem: I want to keep my "right eye" and "right hand." I want purity AND my entertainment options. I want holiness AND my comfort.

Jesus says: Choose.

### Marriage: Covenant Not Contract

Marriage is under assault. Culture says: "If you're not happy, leave."

Jesus says: Covenant. One flesh. What God has joined, man must not separate.

Divorce was NEVER God's design. It was a Mosaic CONCESSION for "hardness of heart."

Jesus restores Genesis 2:24 - the creation intent.

Application:
- Protect my own marriage (or future marriage)
- Speak covenant language, not contract language
- Don't encourage others to "you deserve better"

### Truthfulness: Let Yes Be Yes

Our culture is drowning in spin, exaggeration, lies.

Politicians lie. Advertisers lie. People lie on resumes, dating profiles, social media.

And I lie. I shade the truth. I exaggerate stories. I spin to make myself look better.

Jesus says: Just be TRUTHFUL. All the time. In small things and big things.

If your word needs an oath to be believed, your word is worthless.

### Non-Retaliation: The Second Mile

This one cuts against EVERYTHING in me.

Someone insults me? I want to insult back.
Someone sues me? I want to fight back.
Someone oppresses me? I want justice NOW.

Jesus says: Turn the other cheek. Give your cloak too. Go the second mile.

This isn't passivity. It's ACTIVE absorption of wrong.

Why? To break the cycle of retaliation. To overcome evil with good.

And because Jesus absorbed INFINITE wrong on the cross for me.

### Enemy Love: Be Perfect

"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."

Who are my enemies?
- Political opponents?
- People who've wronged me?
- Those who mock my faith?
- Internet trolls?

Am I praying for them... or cursing them?

Am I seeking their good... or their destruction?

Jesus says: Love them. Pray for them. Bless them.

Why? "So that you may be sons of your Father."

God blesses the evil and the good. Rain on just and unjust. If I only love the lovable, I'm NO DIFFERENT than tax collectors and Gentiles.

"Be perfect, as your Father is perfect."

τέλειος (teleios) = Complete, whole, undivided.

NOT sinless perfection. BUT complete LOVE - even of enemies.

And I can't do this. I fail constantly.

But CHRIST did it. He loved His enemies to death - MY death.

Romans 5:8-10 - "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us... while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son."

### The Sermon's Function: Mirror to Christ

Matthew 5 should drive me to despair... and then to Christ.

I CAN'T do this. Not in my own strength.

But HE did. Perfectly.

And now He lives in me. His Spirit empowers me.

I don't obey Matthew 5 TO BE saved.
I obey Matthew 5 BECAUSE I'm saved.

Not perfectly. But progressively.

Philippians 2:12-13 - "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."

God works in me. I work it out.

The standard: Impossibly high.
The Savior: Infinitely gracious.

## One-Line Distillations

- **Oaths → Truthfulness**: If you need an oath to be believed, your word is already worthless - let yes mean yes
