## Jesus vs. Israel: The True Son

```
ISRAEL IN WILDERNESS              JESUS IN WILDERNESS
(40 YEARS)                        (40 DAYS)
    │                                 │
    ├─ Hungry → Complained            ├─ Hungry → Trusted
    ├─ Tested God at Massah           ├─ Refused to test God
    ├─ Worshiped golden calf          ├─ Worshiped God alone
    └─ FAILED                         └─ PASSED
```

### One-Line Cut
**Where Israel failed for 40 years, Jesus succeeds in 40 days - the True Son passes the test using only the Word.**

## The Call Pattern

```
THE CALL
    │
    ├─ Jesus initiates ◄── He calls, they respond
    ├─ Simple words ◄── "Follow me"
    ├─ Immediate response ◄── "At once" / "Immediately"
    └─ Total commitment ◄── Left everything
```

### One-Line Cut
**No negotiation, no delay - "Follow me" demands everything and gets it.**
