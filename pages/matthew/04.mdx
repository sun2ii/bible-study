# Matthew 4: The King's Testing

> Identity declared, now tested. Jesus enters the wilderness for 40 days, mirroring Israel's 40 years—but where Israel failed at every turn, Jesus succeeds using only Scripture. Satan offers shortcuts: bread without trust, proof without faith, glory without suffering. Jesus refuses every one. Then He emerges, calls fishermen to follow, and demonstrates the kingdom with power. This is what faithful Sonship looks like.

## The Testing Question

```
WHAT PROVES THE SON'S IDENTITY?
    │
    ├─ SATAN'S TEST (vv. 1-11):
    │   └─► Use your power for:
    │       ├─ Self-provision (bread)
    │       ├─ Self-validation (temple jump)
    │       └─ Self-exaltation (kingdoms)
    │           │
    │           └─► Shortcuts that bypass the cross
    │
    ├─ JESUS' RESPONSE:
    │   └─► Trust Father's provision
    │       Trust Father's timing
    │       Worship Father alone
    │       │
    │       └─► Obedience, not shortcuts
    │
    └─ THE PATTERN:
        └─► Where Israel failed (40 years in wilderness)
            Jesus succeeds (40 days in wilderness)
            │
            └─► True Sonship = Faithful obedience
                Using only Scripture
                Trusting Father completely
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. The Temptation in the Wilderness (vv. 1-11) — TESTING THE SON

**Key Greek:**
- πειράζω (peirazō) — "to tempt, test, try" (v. 1, 3)
- διάβολος (diabolos) — "devil, accuser, slanderer" (v. 1, 5, 8, 11)
- γέγραπται (gegraptai) — "it is written" (v. 4, 7, 10)

```
THE SETUP (v. 1)
    │
    └─► "Then Jesus was LED BY THE SPIRIT into the wilderness
         to be TEMPTED by the devil"
        │
        ├─ AGENT: "Led by the Spirit"
        │   └─► ἀνήχθη (anēchthē) — "was led up, brought up"
        │       Passive voice = Spirit is the actor
        │       │
        │       └─► This isn't Satan's ambush
        │           This is PLANNED testing
        │           Father's design
        │
        ├─ LOCATION: "Wilderness"
        │   └─► Same wilderness John baptized in
        │       Desert, isolated, harsh
        │       │
        │       └─► ECHOES: Israel in wilderness (40 years)
        │           Jesus = New Israel
        │           Will He succeed where they failed?
        │
        └─ PURPOSE: "To be tempted"
            │
            └─► πειρασθῆναι (peirasthēnai)
                "To be tested, tried, tempted"
                │
                ├─ BY: The devil (διάβολος, diabolos)
                │   └─► "Slanderer, accuser, adversary"
                │       Same tempter from Garden (Gen 3)
                │
                └─► WHY TEST JESUS?
                    │
                    ├─ Prove His faithfulness
                    ├─ Demonstrate obedience
                    └─► Show He's qualified to be Savior
                        │
                        └─► If He can't resist temptation,
                            He can't save us FROM temptation
```

**The 40 Days (v. 2):**

```
"AFTER FASTING FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS" (v. 2)
    │
    ├─ DURATION: 40 days and nights
    │   └─► Not arbitrary
    │       SYMBOLIC number
    │       │
    │       └─► Biblical 40s:
    │           │
    │           ├─ Moses: 40 days on Mt. Sinai (Ex 34:28)
    │           ├─ Elijah: 40 days to Mt. Horeb (1 Kings 19:8)
    │           ├─ Israel: 40 years in wilderness (Num 14:33-34)
    │           └─► Testing period, preparation time
    │
    ├─ FASTING:
    │   └─► νηστεύσας (nēsteusas) — "having fasted"
    │       No food for 40 days
    │       │
    │       └─► Physical weakness
    │           Human limitation exposed
    │           │
    │           └─► Sets up first temptation
    │
    └─ RESULT: "He was hungry"
        │
        └─► Understatement
            Not "a bit peckish"
            STARVING
            │
            └─► Maximum physical vulnerability
                Perfect time for Satan to strike
```

#### Temptation 1: Bread (vv. 3-4) — SATISFY YOURSELF

```
THE TEMPTATION (v. 3)
    │
    └─► "If you are the Son of God,
         tell these STONES to become BREAD"
        │
        ├─ "IF you are the Son of God"
        │   └─► εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ θεοῦ (ei huios ei tou theou)
        │       │
        │       ├─ NOT questioning IF (doubt)
        │       └─► IS: "Since you are" (condition assumed)
        │           │
        │           └─► Satan knows who Jesus is
        │               He's not doubting identity
        │               He's testing WHAT Jesus will do
        │                   with that identity
        │
        ├─ "Tell these STONES to become BREAD"
        │   └─► The appeal:
        │       │
        │       ├─ You're HUNGRY
        │       ├─ You HAVE the power
        │       └─► Why not USE it?
        │           │
        │           └─► Legitimate need (food)
        │               Legitimate power (Son of God)
        │               │
        │               └─► So what's wrong?
        │
        └─► THE ISSUE:
            │
            └─► Using divine power for SELF-PROVISION
                Instead of TRUSTING FATHER
                │
                ├─ Circumvent Father's provision
                ├─ Act independently
                └─► Satisfy self, not wait on God
                    │
                    └─► Seems small, but it's huge:
                        Will Jesus trust Father
                        even when starving?
```

**Jesus' Response:**

```
"IT IS WRITTEN" (v. 4)
    │
    └─► γέγραπται (gegraptai) — "it stands written"
        Perfect tense = permanent authority
        │
        └─► Quotes Deuteronomy 8:3
            │
            "Man shall not live on BREAD ALONE,
             but on EVERY WORD that comes from
             the mouth of God"
            │
            ├─ CONTEXT (Deut 8:3):
            │   └─► Israel in wilderness
            │       God provided manna
            │       Teaching: Depend on God's word
            │       Not just physical provision
            │
            └─► JESUS' POINT:
                │
                └─► Life sustained by MORE than bread
                    │
                    ├─ Physical food = temporary
                    └─► God's word = eternal sustenance
                        │
                        └─► "EVERY WORD from God's mouth"
                            │
                            ├─ Father hasn't told Jesus
                            │   to make bread
                            │
                            └─► Therefore: WAIT
                                Trust Father's provision
                                Don't act independently
                                │
                                └─► Obedience > Appetite
```

**The Contrast:**

| Israel in Wilderness | Jesus in Wilderness |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Hungry → Grumbled (Ex 16:2-3) | Hungry → Trusted |
| "We're going to starve!" | "Man lives by God's word" |
| Demanded provision | Waited on Father |
| FAILED test | PASSED test |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I trust God's provision, or demand satisfaction on my terms?*

**One-line:** Jesus refuses to use divine power for self-comfort—trust outlasts hunger.

#### Temptation 2: Temple (vv. 5-7) — PROVE YOURSELF

```
THE SETUP (v. 5)
    │
    └─► "Then the devil took him to the holy city
         and had him stand on the HIGHEST POINT of the temple"
        │
        ├─ LOCATION: Jerusalem ("holy city")
        │   └─► The religious center
        │       Most sacred place
        │
        └─ POSITION: "Highest point of the temple"
            │
            └─► πτερύγιον (pterygion) — "pinnacle, highest point"
                Likely southeast corner
                450-foot drop to Kidron Valley below
                │
                └─► Public, dramatic, visible
                    Perfect stage for a sign
```

**The Temptation (v. 6):**

```
"IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD, THROW YOURSELF DOWN" (v. 6)
    │
    ├─ Same "IF" as before
    │   └─► "Since you are the Son..."
    │       Not doubting, testing
    │
    ├─ THE COMMAND: "Throw yourself down"
    │   └─► βάλε σεαυτὸν κάτω (bale seauton katō)
    │       "Cast yourself down"
    │       │
    │       └─► Spectacular leap
    │           Public demonstration
    │           Undeniable proof
    │
    └─ THE JUSTIFICATION: Satan quotes SCRIPTURE
        │
        └─► Psalm 91:11-12
            "He will command his angels concerning you,
             and they will lift you up in their hands,
             so that you will not strike your foot
             against a stone"
            │
            ├─ Satan's logic:
            │   └─► Scripture promises protection
            │       You're the Son of God
            │       THEREFORE: Jump!
            │       Angels will save you
            │       Prove your identity
            │
            └─► THE APPEAL:
                │
                ├─ Validate yourself publicly
                ├─ Remove all doubt
                └─► Force God's hand
                    │
                    └─► If God's word is true,
                        He MUST save you
```

**What's Wrong with This?**

```
THE PROBLEM
    │
    └─► Not TESTING God's word
        TESTING God Himself
        │
        ├─ God WILL keep His promises
        │   └─► In HIS timing
        │       For HIS purposes
        │       Not on DEMAND
        │
        └─► This is PRESUMPTION
            │
            └─► Creating situation REQUIRING rescue
                To PROVE God will act
                │
                └─► Manipulating God
                    Demanding proof
                    Testing faithfulness
```

**Jesus' Response (v. 7):**

```
"IT IS ALSO WRITTEN" (v. 7)
    │
    └─► πάλιν γέγραπται (palin gegraptai)
        "Again it stands written"
        │
        └─► Quotes Deuteronomy 6:16
            │
            "Do not PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST"
            │
            ├─ CONTEXT (Deut 6:16):
            │   └─► Israel at Massah (Ex 17:1-7)
            │       No water in desert
            │       They DEMANDED: "Is God with us or not?"
            │       │
            │       └─► Tested God = Demanded proof
            │           Instead of trusting
            │
            └─► JESUS' POINT:
                │
                └─► Scripture interprets Scripture
                    │
                    ├─ Yes, God promises protection (Ps 91)
                    └─► But NO, don't test Him (Deut 6:16)
                        │
                        └─► Difference:
                            │
                            ├─ FAITH: Trusts without proof
                            └─► PRESUMPTION: Demands proof
                                │
                                └─► Jesus won't manipulate Father
                                    Won't force His hand
                                    Will trust WITHOUT spectacular sign
```

**The Contrast:**

| Israel at Massah | Jesus at Temple |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Demanded proof: "Is God with us?" | Refused to demand proof |
| Tested God | Trusted God |
| FAILED test | PASSED test |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I trust God without proof, or demand signs to validate Him?*

**One-line:** Jesus refuses spectacular proof—faith doesn't demand validation.

#### Temptation 3: Kingdoms (vv. 8-10) — EXALT YOURSELF

```
THE SETUP (v. 8)
    │
    └─► "Again, the devil took him to a VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN
         and showed him ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD
         and their SPLENDOR"
        │
        ├─ LOCATION: "Very high mountain"
        │   └─► Symbolic viewpoint
        │       Comprehensive vision
        │
        └─ THE VISION: "All kingdoms... and their splendor"
            │
            └─► πάσας τὰς βασιλείας... καὶ τὴν δόξαν
                "All the kingdoms... and the glory"
                │
                ├─ Political power
                ├─ Wealth, prestige
                └─► Everything humanity values
                    │
                    └─► This IS Jesus' mission goal
                        He came to RECLAIM kingdoms
                        Establish God's rule
                        │
                        └─► So Satan offers shortcut
```

**The Offer (v. 9):**

```
"ALL THIS I WILL GIVE YOU IF YOU WILL BOW DOWN
 AND WORSHIP ME" (v. 9)
    │
    ├─ THE OFFER: "All this I will give you"
    │   └─► Every kingdom
    │       All authority
    │       Complete dominion
    │       │
    │       └─► Satan's claim:
    │           "I can give this"
    │           │
    │           └─► IS IT TRUE?

**What's the Real Issue?**

```
THE CHOICE
    │
    ├─ SATAN'S WAY:

    │       Kingdoms WITHOUT sacrifice
    │       │
    │       └─► One bow → Everything
    │
    └─ FATHER'S WAY:

            Cross → Crown
            Death → Resurrection
            │
            └─► Obedience → Everything
                │
                └─► Which path will Jesus take?
```

**Jesus' Response (v. 10):**

```
"AWAY FROM ME, SATAN!" (v. 10)
    │
    └─► Ὕπαγε, Σατανᾶ (Hypage, Satana)
        "Get behind me, Satan"
        │
        ├─ IMMEDIATE rejection
        │   └─► No consideration
        │       No negotiation
        │       INSTANT refusal
        │
        └─► "FOR IT IS WRITTEN"
            │
            └─► Quotes Deuteronomy 6:13
                │
                "WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD,
                 and SERVE HIM ONLY"
                │
                ├─ CONTEXT (Deut 6:13):
                │   └─► First commandment
                │       No other gods
                │       Exclusive worship
                │

                    │
                    └─► Non-negotiable principle
                        │
                        ├─ WORSHIP = God alone
                        ├─ SERVICE = God alone
                        └─► NO exceptions

                                        MEANS that violate worship
```

**The Contrast:**

| Israel in Wilderness | Jesus in Wilderness |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Made golden calf (Ex 32) | Worshiped God only |
| Bowed to idol | Refused to bow to Satan |
| FAILED test | PASSED test |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I compromise worship for results, or maintain exclusive loyalty to God?*

**One-line:** Jesus refuses glory without suffering—the cross is not negotiable.

#### The Aftermath (v. 11)

```
"THEN THE DEVIL LEFT HIM" (v. 11)
    │

    │       │
    │       └─► Temporary retreat
    │           Luke 4:13: "Until an opportune time"
    │           │
    │           └─► Satan will return:
    │               Gethsemane, Golgotha
    │               But Jesus will win there too
    │
    └─► "AND ANGELS CAME AND ATTENDED HIM"
        │
        └─► διηκόνουν (diēkonoun) — "ministered to, served"
            │
            ├─ Physical care (food, strength)
            ├─ Spiritual encouragement
            └─► Heavenly reinforcement
                │

                    ├─ Test completed
                    ├─ Victory won
                    └─► Now: provision comes
                        │
                        └─► Father provides AFTER obedience
                            Not before
                            Not during demand
                            AFTER faithful trust
```

**The Victory Summary:**

```
JESUS DEFEATS SATAN USING
    │
    ├─ Scripture ONLY
    │   └─► Three temptations
    │       Three "It is written" responses
    │       │
    │       └─► The sword of the Spirit (Eph 6:17)
    │           Word of God = weapon
    │
    ├─ Father's WILL
    │   └─► Refuses shortcuts
    │       Trusts Father's timing
    │       │
    │       └─► Obedience > Comfort
    │           Obedience > Proof
    │           Obedience > Glory
    │
    └─► NO other power demonstrated
        │
        └─► Not miracles
            Not angelic armies
            Just SCRIPTURE
            │
            └─► Pattern for US:
                We fight same way
                Same weapon
                Same trust
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I fight temptation with Scripture, or with my own reasoning?*

**One-line:** Jesus wins using only what we have—Scripture and trust.

THE TRANSITION (vv. 12-13)

    ├─ v. 12: "When Jesus heard that JOHN HAD BEEN PUT IN PRISON"
    │   └─► παρεδόθη (paredothē) — "was handed over, betrayed"
    │       │
    │       └─► Herod Antipas arrested John (ch. 14)
    │           John's ministry ending

```

**Settling in Capernaum (v. 13):**

```
"LEAVING NAZARETH, HE WENT AND LIVED IN CAPERNAUM" (v. 13)
    │
    ├─ LEAVING: Nazareth (hometown)
    │   └─► Where He grew up
    │       But rejected there (Luke 4:16-30)

#### The Isaiah Prophecy (vv. 14-16)

```
"TO FULFILL WHAT WAS SAID THROUGH ISAIAH" (vv. 14-16)
    │
    └─► Isaiah 9:1-2
        │
        "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
         the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan,
         Galilee of the Gentiles—
         the people living in DARKNESS
         have seen a GREAT LIGHT;
         on those living in the land of the shadow of death
         a light has DAWNED"
        │
        ├─ ORIGINAL CONTEXT (Isaiah 9:1-2):
        │   └─► Written ~700 BC
        │       Assyrian invasion devastated north
        │       Zebulun, Naphtali first conquered (722 BC)
        │       Darkness = judgment, exile, oppression
        │       │
        │       └─► But promise: LIGHT coming
        │           Future hope
        │
        └─ MATTHEW'S FULFILLMENT:
            │
            └─► Jesus = the LIGHT
                │
                ├─ "People living in DARKNESS"
                │   └─► σκότει (skotei) — darkness
                │       │
                │       ├─ Physical: Gentile territory
                │       ├─ Spiritual: Away from Jerusalem
                │       └─► Moral: Sin, oppression
                │
                ├─ "Shadow of DEATH"
                │   └─► σκιᾷ θανάτου (skia thanatou)
                │       Deepest darkness
                │       Hopelessness
                │
                └─ "GREAT LIGHT has dawned"
                    └─► φῶς μέγα (phōs mega)
                        │
                        └─► Not gradual improvement
                            SUDDEN breakthrough
                            Light DAWNED
                            │
                            └─► Jesus arrives = Light invades
```

**The Light Imagery:**

| Darkness | Light |
|----------|-------|
| Gentile territory | Jesus in Galilee |
| Spiritual ignorance | Teaching with authority |
| Oppression, death | Healing, life |
| Despised region | God's presence |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see Jesus as incremental improvement, or breakthrough light?*

**One-line:** Light doesn't negotiate with darkness—it invades and conquers.

                            Jesus BRINGS kingdom
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see Jesus' ministry as new teaching, or kingdom invasion?*

**One-line:** Same message as John, but now the King Himself speaks.

#### James and John (vv. 21-22)

```
THE SECOND PAIR (vv. 21-22)
    │
    ├─ WHO (v. 21):
    │   └─► "James son of Zebedee
    │        and his brother John"
    │       │
    │       ├─ JAMES: Ἰάκωβος (Iakōbos)
    │       │   Hebrew: Ya'akov (Jacob)
    │       │
    │       └─ JOHN: Ἰωάννης (Iōannēs)
    │           Later writes Gospel, 3 letters, Revelation
    │
    ├─ WHERE (v. 21):
    │   └─► "In a boat with their father Zebedee"
    │       │
    │       └─► Family business
    │           Father present
    │           Established operation
    │
    ├─ WHAT (v. 21):
    │   └─► "Preparing their nets"
    │       │
    │       └─► καταρτίζοντας (katartizontas)
    │           "Mending, repairing, preparing"
    │           │
    │           └─► Maintenance work
    │               Daily routine
    │
    ├─ THE CALL (v. 21):
    │   └─► "Jesus called them"
    │       │
    │       └─► ἐκάλεσεν (ekalesen) — "called, summoned"
    │           Same authority as first pair
    │           Same invitation
    │
    └─ THE RESPONSE (v. 22):
        │
        └─► "IMMEDIATELY they left the boat
             and their FATHER and FOLLOWED him"
            │
            ├─ "IMMEDIATELY"
            │   └─► εὐθέως (eutheōs) again
            │       No hesitation
            │
            └─ "Left the boat and their FATHER"
                │
                └─► Even MORE costly:
                    │
                    ├─ Boat = business assets
                    ├─ Father = family obligation
                    └─► Zebedee left with nets to mend
                        │
                        └─► Family relationships subordinate
                            to Jesus' call
```

**The Calling Pattern:**

```
JESUS' CALL
    │
    ├─ INITIATIVE: He calls (not rabbis chosen)
    ├─ SIMPLE: "Follow me" (not complex requirements)
    ├─ TRANSFORMATIVE: "I will make you" (not self-effort)
    └─► IMMEDIATE: "At once" they respond
        │
        └─► No negotiation
            No conditions
            Total commitment
```

**What They Left:**

| Disciple Pair | What They Left | Cost |
|---------------|----------------|------|
| **Peter & Andrew** | Nets | Livelihood, income |
| **James & John** | Boat + Father | Assets + family obligation |

**Diagnostic:** *What would I need to leave to follow Jesus completely?*

**One-line:** "Follow me" demands everything—no negotiation, no delay, just obedience.

### 4. Healing and Proclamation (vv. 23-25) — KINGDOM DEMONSTRATED

**Key Greek:**
- διδάσκων (didaskōn) — "teaching" (v. 23)
- κηρύσσων (kēryssōn) — "proclaiming, preaching" (v. 23)
- θεραπεύων (therapeuōn) — "healing" (v. 23)

```
THE SUMMARY STATEMENT (v. 23)

    └─► Three activities define Jesus' ministry:
        │
        ├─ TEACHING
        │   └─► διδάσκων (didaskōn) — "teaching"
        │       │
        │       └─► "In their synagogues"
        │           │

        │
        ├─ PROCLAIMING
        │   └─► κηρύσσων (kēryssōn) — "preaching, proclaiming"
        │       │
        │       └─► "The GOOD NEWS of the kingdom"
        │           │
        │           └─► τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς βασιλείας
        │               (to euangelion tēs basileias)
        │               │
        │               ├─ εὐαγγέλιον = "good news, gospel"
        │               └─► Kingdom announced
        │                   God's rule breaking in
        │
        └─ HEALING
            └─► θεραπεύων (therapeuōn) — "healing, curing"
                │
                └─► "EVERY disease and sickness
                     among the people"
                    │
                    └─► πᾶσαν νόσον καὶ πᾶσαν μαλακίαν
                        (pasan noson kai pasan malakian)
                        │
                        ├─ πᾶσαν (pasan) = "every, all"
                        │   Used TWICE
                        │   Total, comprehensive healing
                        │
                        ├─ νόσον (noson) = "disease, illness"
                        └─ μαλακίαν (malakian) = "sickness, weakness"
                            │
                            └─► No exceptions
                                No failures
                                100% healing rate
```

**The Ministry Pattern:**

```
WORD + DEED
    │
    ├─ WORD (Teaching + Preaching)
    │   └─► Announces kingdom
    │       Explains God's rule
    │       │
    │       └─► What kingdom IS
    │
    └─ DEED (Healing)
        └─► Demonstrates kingdom
            Proves God's power
            │
            └─► What kingdom DOES
                │
                └─► INTEGRITY:
                    Message matches power
                    Claims proven by action
```

**The Results (vv. 24-25):**

```
FAME SPREADS (v. 24)
    │
    └─► "News about him spread ALL OVER SYRIA"
        │
        ├─ SYRIA: Entire region
        │   └─► Not just Galilee
        │       Provincial fame → Regional fame
        │
        └─ PEOPLE BROUGHT "all the sick"
            │
            └─► "Those suffering SEVERE PAIN"
                "The DEMON-POSSESSED"
                "Those having SEIZURES"
                "The PARALYZED"
                │
                └─► Every category of suffering:
                    │
                    ├─ Physical pain
                    ├─ Spiritual oppression
                    ├─ Neurological disorders
                    └─► Mobility issues
                        │
                        └─► "And he HEALED them"
                            │
                            └─► ἐθεράπευσεν (etherapeusen)
                                100% success rate
                                No failures recorded

CROWDS FOLLOW (v. 25)
    │
    └─► "Large crowds from GALILEE,
         the DECAPOLIS, JERUSALEM, JUDEA
         and the region ACROSS THE JORDAN followed him"
        │
        └─► Five regions listed:
            │
            ├─ Galilee (north, Jewish)
            ├─ Decapolis (east, Gentile cities)
            ├─ Jerusalem (center, religious capital)
            ├─ Judea (south, Jewish heartland)
            └─ Across Jordan (east, mixed)
                │
                └─► COMPREHENSIVE response
                    │
                    ├─ Jewish + Gentile
                    ├─ Religious + secular
                    └─► All drawn to Jesus
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I want Jesus' teaching without His demands, or both together?*

**One-line:** Jesus proves His words with power—kingdom announced AND demonstrated.

## Unified Framework

```
MATTHEW 4: THE QUALIFIED KING
    │
    ├─ TEMPTATION (vv. 1-11):
    │   ├─► Three tests, three victories
    │   ├─► Using Scripture alone
    │   ├─► Where Israel failed, Jesus succeeds
    │   └─► Proven: Faithful Son
    │       │
    │       └─► QUALIFICATION: Tested and approved
    │
    ├─ MINISTRY LAUNCH (vv. 12-17):
    │   ├─► Withdraws to Galilee
    │   ├─► Fulfills Isaiah 9 (light in darkness)
    │   └─► Preaches: "Repent, kingdom near"
    │       │
    │       └─► PROCLAMATION: Light invades darkness
    │
    ├─ CALLING DISCIPLES (vv. 18-22):
    │   ├─► Calls fishermen
    │   ├─► "Follow me"
    │   └─► Immediate, total response
    │       │
    │       └─► MISSION: Building team
    │
    └─ KINGDOM POWER (vv. 23-25):
        ├─► Teaching, preaching, healing
        ├─► Every disease healed
        └─► Crowds from everywhere follow
            │
            └─► DEMONSTRATION: Word + deed = kingdom
```

**The Chapter's Core Logic:**

```
FROM TESTING TO MISSION
    │
    ├─ Identity declared (ch. 3:17)
    │   └─► "This is my Son"
    │
    ├─ Identity tested (4:1-11)
    │   └─► Wilderness temptations
    │       Proven faithful
    │
    └─ Mission launched (4:12-25)
        │
        └─► Teaching + Healing
            Calling + Demonstrating
            │
            └─► Qualified King → Active ministry
```

---

## Diagnostic Summary

| Section | Core Question |
|---------|---------------|
| Bread temptation | Do I trust God's provision or demand satisfaction? |
| Temple temptation | Do I trust without proof or demand validation? |
| Kingdoms temptation | Do I take shortcuts or embrace God's path? |
| Scripture weapon | Do I fight with God's Word or my reasoning? |
| Light in darkness | Do I see Jesus as improvement or invasion? |
| Disciple calling | What would I need to leave to follow completely? |
| Word + deed | Do I want teaching without power, or both? |

---

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Matthew 4:** Jesus defeats Satan in the wilderness using Scripture alone—succeeding where Israel failed—then launches His ministry in Galilee fulfilling Isaiah's light prophecy, calls fishermen to immediate discipleship, and demonstrates the kingdom through teaching and comprehensive healing that draws crowds from every region.

## Personal Notes

### The Three Temptations Hit Different

I used to think Satan's temptations were obviously evil. Read them again—they're GOOD things offered through BAD means.

```
WHAT SATAN OFFERED
    │
    ├─ Bread: Satisfy legitimate hunger
    ├─ Temple: Prove you're God's Son (which is TRUE)
    └─ Kingdoms: Fulfill your mission (which He came to do)
        │
        └─► All GOOD goals
            All LEGITIMATE desires
            │
            └─► But accomplished through:
                │
                ├─ Independence (don't trust Father)
                ├─ Presumption (force God's hand)
                └─ Compromise (worship Satan)
```

This is how Satan works in my life:
- Career advancement (good) through ethical shortcuts (bad)
- Ministry success (good) through pride (bad)
- Influence (good) through compromise (bad)

**The lesson:** Right goals don't justify wrong means.

### Jesus Used ONLY Scripture

Three temptations. Three "It is written" responses. That's it.

```
WHAT JESUS DIDN'T USE
    │
    ├─ Theological arguments
    ├─ Philosophical reasoning
    ├─ Angelic reinforcements
    └─ Divine power display
        │
        └─► Just SCRIPTURE
```

Why?

```
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE
    │
    └─► Jesus modeled how WE fight
        │
        ├─ Not with powers we don't possess
        └─► With the weapon we DO have
            │
            └─► Word of God
                Memorized
                Applied
                Trusted
```

I try to fight temptation with:
- Willpower (fails)
- Distraction (temporary)
- Reasoning (weak)

Jesus shows: Scripture is the sword. Use it.

**Application:** If I don't know Scripture, I'm unarmed in the fight.

### The Israel Parallels Are Intentional

Matthew structures this deliberately:

| Israel | Jesus | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 40 years | 40 days | Testing period |
| Hungry → Grumbled | Hungry → Trusted | Bread test |
| Tested God (Massah) | Refused to test | Temple test |
| Golden calf | Worship God only | Kingdoms test |
| FAILED | PASSED | Outcome |

```
THE PATTERN
    │
    └─► Jesus = NEW Israel
        TRUE Son
        │
        └─► Where first son failed
            Second Son succeeds
            │
            └─► Adam failed → Jesus succeeded
                Israel failed → Jesus succeeded
                I fail → Jesus succeeds
                │
                └─► My hope: NOT my obedience
                    HIS perfect obedience
```

### The Calling Shows Lordship

vv. 18-22: Jesus walks up, says "Follow me," and they DROP EVERYTHING.

```
WHAT'S SHOCKING
    │
    ├─ No resume presentation
    ├─ No benefit package
    ├─ No job description
    └─ No "think about it"
        │
        └─► Just: "Follow me"
            And they do
            IMMEDIATELY
```

This reveals Jesus' authority:

```
NORMAL RABBI-STUDENT
    │
    ├─ Student seeks rabbi
    ├─ Proves worthiness
    └─ Gets accepted
        │
        └─► Student initiative

JESUS' PATTERN
    │
    ├─ Jesus seeks students
    ├─ No qualifications required
    └─ Simple command: "Follow"
        │
        └─► Jesus' initiative
            │
            └─► Because He's NOT just a rabbi
                He's LORD
```

What did they leave?
- Peter/Andrew: Nets (livelihood)
- James/John: Boat + Father (assets + family)

**The cost:** Everything.

**The promise:** "I will make you..."

I want discipleship that:
- Doesn't cost much
- Fits my schedule
- Doesn't disrupt relationships

Jesus' call: Leave everything. NOW.

### Word + Deed = Integrity

v. 23: Jesus taught + preached + healed.

```
THE PATTERN
    │
    ├─ WORD (teaching/preaching)
    │   └─► "Kingdom of heaven is near"
    │       Claims authority
    │
    └─ DEED (healing)
        └─► Demonstrates authority
            Proves claims
            │
            └─► Integrity = Claims match power
```

This wrecks modern Christianity's divisions:

```
WORD WITHOUT DEED
    │
    └─► Theology without power
        Knowledge without transformation
        │
        └─► "We teach the kingdom"
            But nothing changes

DEED WITHOUT WORD
    │
    └─► Power without truth
        Experience without foundation
        │
        └─► "We see miracles"
            But don't know why
```

Jesus: BOTH. Always.

**Application:** My Christian life should show both truth AND transformation. Theology that doesn't change me is incomplete. Experience that isn't grounded in truth is dangerous.

### The Comprehensive Healing

v. 23: "Every disease and sickness"

```
JESUS' HEALING RECORD
    │
    └─► 100% success rate
        │
        ├─ No failures
        ├─ No "couldn't heal this one"
        └─► EVERY disease
            │
            └─► Why?
                │
                └─► Demonstrating:
                    Kingdom power is TOTAL
                    Not partial
                    Not "maybe"
                    COMPREHENSIVE
```

This raises the "why doesn't He heal everyone now?" question. I don't have clean answers. What I see:

1. **This was DEMONSTRATION phase**
   - Proving His identity
   - Showing kingdom power
   - Credentials for claims

2. **Not all purposes are healing**
   - Paul's thorn (2 Cor 12:7-10)
   - Some suffering builds character (Rom 5:3-5)
   - Full healing waits for consummation (Rev 21:4)

3. **The pattern remains: Jesus CAN**
   - Power hasn't diminished
   - Authority unchanged
   - We pray in faith, trust His wisdom

**The tension I live in:** Jesus healed everyone then. He doesn't always heal now. I trust His power AND His purposes.

---

## Final Takeaway

Matthew 4 shows QUALIFICATION before MISSION.

```
THE SEQUENCE
    │
    ├─ Ch 3: Identity declared
    │   └─► "This is my Son"
    │
    ├─ Ch 4:1-11: Identity tested
    │   └─► Wilderness proves faithfulness
    │
    └─ Ch 4:12-25: Mission launched
        └─► Teaching, healing, calling
            │
            └─► Proven King → Active ministry
```

I want mission without testing. I want authority without proving. Jesus shows: Testing comes FIRST.

The wilderness isn't a detour. It's preparation.
