# Matthew 10: Sent with Authority

> Jesus transfers His authority to ordinary men. The Twelve receive power to heal and cast out demons—the same works Jesus does. But with authority comes cost: persecution is guaranteed, families will divide, and death is possible. The mission is not safe, but it is clear: proclaim the kingdom, fear only God, and remember that to receive a disciple is to receive Jesus Himself.

    │
    ├─ vv. 5-15   FOCUS          → Strategic boundaries

    │       They'll hate you like they hated me
    │
    ├─ vv. 26-31  COURAGE        → Do not fear (3x)
    │   └─► Nothing hidden that won't be revealed

```

---

## The Authority Transfer

```
JESUS' AUTHORITY → DISCIPLES' AUTHORITY
    │
    ├─ Ch. 8-9: Jesus demonstrates
    │   ├─ Over demons
    │   ├─ Over disease
    │   ├─ Over nature
    │   └─ Over death
    │
    └─ Ch. 10: Jesus delegates
        │
        ├─ v. 1: "Authority to drive out impure spirits
        │         and to heal every disease and sickness"
        │
        └─► Same power
            Different agents
            Extended reach
```

**Key insight:** Jesus doesn't keep the power centralized. He multiplies His ministry by distributing His authority.

## Section Analysis

### 1. The Twelve (vv. 1-4) — DELEGATION

```
THE TWELVE
    │
    ├─ Simon Peter + Andrew (brothers, fishermen)
    ├─ James + John (brothers, "sons of thunder")
    ├─ Philip + Bartholomew
    ├─ Thomas + Matthew (the tax collector)
    ├─ James son of Alphaeus + Thaddaeus
    ├─ Simon the Zealot (anti-Rome radical)
    └─ Judas Iscariot (who betrayed him)
        │
        └─► Unlikely team
            Political opposites (Zealot + tax collector)
            Diverse personalities
            One traitor included
```

```
THE AUTHORITY GIVEN (v. 1)
    │
    ├─ "Authority over impure spirits"
    │   └─► Drive them out
    │
    └─ "Heal every disease and sickness"
        │
        └─► Same scope as Jesus (9:35)
            Not partial power
            Full delegation
```

```
THE SIGNIFICANCE
    │
    ├─ They don't have this authority inherently
    │   └─► It's GIVEN by Jesus
    │
    └─► They operate under His name
        His authority travels through them
        │
        └─► Like the centurion understood (8:9)
            Delegated authority still carries weight
```

**The Twelve Profiled:**

| Name | Background | Notable |
|------|------------|---------|
| Peter | Fisherman, brother of Andrew | Impulsive leader |
| Andrew | Fisherman, brought Peter to Jesus | Connector |
| James & John | "Sons of Thunder" | Ambitious, passionate |
| Philip | From Bethsaida | Brought Nathanael |
| Bartholomew | Likely = Nathanael | "True Israelite" |
| Thomas | "The Twin" | Doubter, but loyal |
| Matthew | Tax collector (author) | Transformed outcast |
| James (Alphaeus) | Lesser-known | Quiet faithfulness |
| Thaddaeus | Also called Judas (not Iscariot) | Asked key question (Jn 14:22) |
| Simon Zealot | Political revolutionary | Radical turned disciple |
| Judas Iscariot | Treasurer | The betrayer |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see myself as carrying delegated authority, or just following good advice?*

**One-line:** Jesus transfers His authority—they don't generate power, they carry His.

---

### 2. Mission Boundaries (vv. 5-15) — FOCUS

**Key insight:** Restrictions are strategic, not prejudicial. Israel first = fulfilling covenant order.

```
GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES (vv. 5-6)
    │
    ├─ "DO NOT go among the Gentiles"
    ├─ "DO NOT enter any town of the Samaritans"
    │
    └─► GO: "to the lost sheep of Israel"
        │
        └─► Why the restriction?
            │
            ├─ Covenant sequence: Israel first (Rom 1:16)
            ├─ Prophetic fulfillment: Messiah to His people
            └─ Practical: They're not ready yet
                │
                └─► After resurrection: "all nations" (28:19)
```

```
MESSAGE (vv. 7-8)
    │
    ├─ PROCLAIM: "The kingdom of heaven has come near"
    │   └─► Same message as Jesus (4:17)
    │
    └─ DEMONSTRATE:
        ├─ Heal the sick
        ├─ Raise the dead
        ├─ Cleanse lepers
        └─ Drive out demons
            │
            └─► Word + deed
                Proclamation + demonstration
                │
                └─► "Freely you have received; freely give"
```

```
PROVISION PHILOSOPHY (vv. 9-15)
    │
    ├─ TRAVEL LIGHT (vv. 9-10)
    │   ├─ No gold, silver, copper
    │   ├─ No bag, extra shirt, sandals
    │   ├─ No staff
    │   │
    │   └─► Why? "The worker is worth his keep"
    │       │
    │       └─► Dependence on God through others
    │           Not self-sufficiency
    │           Vulnerability as trust
    │
    ├─ STAY STRATEGY (vv. 11-13)
    │   ├─ Find a "worthy person" in each town
    │   ├─ Stay in ONE house (don't trade up)
    │   └─ Give your peace / withdraw it
    │       │
    │       └─► Your presence carries blessing or judgment
    │
    └─ REJECTION PROTOCOL (vv. 14-15)
        │
        ├─ "Shake the dust off your feet"
        │   └─► Physical act of separation
        │       "We're done here"
        │
        └─► "More bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah"
            │
            └─► Greater light = greater accountability
                To reject the gospel is worse than
                rejecting conscience alone
```

**The Provision Paradox:**

| What They Lack | What They Gain |
|----------------|----------------|
| Money | Dependence on Father |
| Extra clothes | Trust in provision |
| Security | Freedom from anxiety |
| Control | Experience of God's faithfulness |

**Diagnostic:** *Am I traveling light, or am I hedging my bets?*

**One-line:** Strategic dependence builds trust; self-sufficiency builds anxiety.

---

### 3. Coming Persecution (vv. 16-25) — EXPECTATION

```
THE SETUP (v. 16)
    │
    └─► "I am sending you out like SHEEP among WOLVES"
        │
        ├─ Not: "like lions among sheep"
        ├─ Not: "like wolves among wolves"
        └─► IS: vulnerable among predators
            │
            └─► Therefore:
                "Be as SHREWD as snakes
                 and as INNOCENT as doves"
                │
                ├─ Shrewd (φρόνιμοι) = wise, prudent
                └─ Innocent (ἀκέραιοι) = pure, unmixed
                    │
                    └─► Cunning without corruption
                        Strategic without sin
```

```
WHAT'S COMING (vv. 17-23)
    │
    ├─ LOCAL PERSECUTION (vv. 17-18)
    │   ├─ Handed over to local councils
    │   ├─ Flogged in synagogues
    │   └─ Brought before governors and kings
    │       │
    │       └─► "On my account"
    │           Not for crime
    │           For confession
    │
    ├─ FAMILY BETRAYAL (v. 21)
    │   ├─ "Brother will betray brother to death"
    │   ├─ "Father will betray child"
    │   └─ "Children will rebel against parents"
    │       │
    │       └─► The gospel divides households
    │
    ├─ UNIVERSAL HATRED (v. 22)
    │   └─► "You will be HATED by everyone
    │        because of me"
    │       │
    │       └─► "But the one who stands firm
    │            to the end will be saved"
    │
    └─ PERSECUTION RESPONSE (v. 23)
        └─► "When persecuted in one place,
             flee to another"
            │
            ├─ Not: "stand and fight"
            ├─ Not: "compromise to survive"
            └─► IS: keep moving, keep proclaiming
                │
                └─► "You will not finish going through
                     the towns of Israel before
                     the Son of Man comes"
```

```
THE ENCOURAGEMENT (vv. 19-20, 24-25)
    │
    ├─ WHEN ARRESTED (vv. 19-20):
    │   "Do not worry about what to say or how to say it"
    │   │
    │   └─► "It will not be you speaking,
    │        but the Spirit of your Father
    │        speaking through you"
    │       │
    │       └─► Promised articulation under pressure
    │
    └─ STUDENT = TEACHER (vv. 24-25)
        │
        ├─ "The student is not above the teacher"
        ├─ "Nor a servant above his master"
        │
        └─► "If the head of the house has been
             called Beelzebul, how much more
             the members of his household!"
            │
            └─► They called Jesus demon-possessed (9:34)
                Expect the same treatment
                │
                └─► You're in good company
```

**Persecution Flow:**

```
JESUS → DISCIPLES
    │
    ├─ They rejected Him → They'll reject you
    ├─ They accused Him → They'll accuse you
    └─ They killed Him → They'll kill you
        │
        └─► Not: "Maybe it won't be that bad"
            IS: "This is the path"
```

**Diagnostic:** *Am I surprised by hostility, or do I expect it?*

**One-line:** Sheep among wolves don't hope to avoid teeth—they trust the Shepherd.

---

### 4. Fear Not (vv. 26-31) — COURAGE

```
THREE "DO NOT FEAR" COMMANDS
    │
    ├─ v. 26: "Do not be afraid of THEM"
    │   └─► "There is nothing concealed
    │        that will not be disclosed"
    │       │
    │       └─► Truth comes out
    │           Their accusations won't last
    │           Your vindication is coming
    │
    ├─ v. 28: "Do not be afraid of those who
    │           kill the BODY but cannot kill the SOUL"
    │   └─► "Rather, be afraid of the One who can
    │        destroy both soul and body in hell"
    │       │
    │       └─► Fear Hierarchy:
    │           │
    │           ├─ Man: Can kill body (temporary)
    │           └─ God: Can destroy soul (eternal)
    │               │
    │               └─► The greater fear cancels the lesser
    │
    └─ v. 31: "So DON'T BE AFRAID"
        └─► "You are worth more than many sparrows"
```

```
THE SPARROW ARGUMENT (vv. 29-31)
    │
    ├─ "Two sparrows sold for a penny"
    │   └─► Cheapest, most common birds
    │       Nearly worthless economically
    │
    ├─ "Yet not one of them will fall to the ground
    │    outside your Father's care"
    │   └─► God tracks every sparrow death
    │       Nothing escapes His notice
    │
    ├─ "Even the very HAIRS of your head
    │    are all NUMBERED"
    │   └─► Not just counted
    │       NUMBERED
    │       Individually catalogued
    │
    └─► THEREFORE: "You are worth more
                     than many sparrows"
        │
        └─► If God tracks worthless sparrows,
            how much more valuable humans?
            │
            └─► A fortiori argument:
                Lesser to greater
                If that, then how much more this
```

**The Fear Ladder:**

| What to Fear | Why | Duration |
|--------------|-----|----------|
| Man's threats | Can kill body | Temporary |
| God's judgment | Can destroy soul | Eternal |
| ↓ |
| **Conclusion:** Fear of God displaces fear of man |

**Diagnostic:** *What am I more afraid of—man's rejection or God's?*

**One-line:** The One who counts your hairs won't lose track of your life.

---

### 5. Confession (vv. 32-33) — LOYALTY

```
THE MIRROR PRINCIPLE
    │
    ├─ "Whoever ACKNOWLEDGES me before others..."
    │   └─► "I will also ACKNOWLEDGE before my Father in heaven"
    │
    └─ "But whoever DISOWNS me before others..."
        └─► "I will DISOWN before my Father in heaven"
            │
            └─► What you do on earth
                Jesus does in heaven
                │
                └─► Your confession = His confession
                    Your denial = His denial
```

```
THE STAKES
    │
    ├─ ACKNOWLEDGE (ὁμολογέω):
    │   ├─ Public identification with Jesus
    │   ├─ "Yes, I follow Him"
    │   └─ Risk: social cost, persecution, death
    │       │
    │       └─► Gain: Jesus identifies you before Father
    │
    └─ DISOWN (ἀρνέομαι):
        ├─ Public denial of Jesus
        ├─ "I don't know Him"
        └─ Gain: safety, acceptance, survival
            │
            └─► Loss: Jesus denies you before Father
```

**Historical echo:** Peter will deny Jesus 3x (26:69-75)—then be restored and confess publicly (Acts 2).

**Diagnostic:** *Have I publicly acknowledged Jesus, or am I a secret follower?*

**One-line:** Your earthly confession determines Jesus' heavenly confession.

---

### 6. Not Peace but a Sword (vv. 34-39) — DIVISION

```
THE SHOCKING CLAIM (v. 34)
    │
    └─► "Do not suppose that I have come
         to bring PEACE to the earth.
         I did not come to bring peace, but a SWORD."
        │
        ├─ Not: the Messiah brings peace (true, but not yet)
        ├─ Not: follow me for a peaceful life (false)
        └─► IS: the gospel creates division
            │
            └─► Before final peace comes division
                Before unity comes separation
                Before reconciliation comes conflict
```

```
THE DIVISION (vv. 35-36)
    │
    └─► "I have come to turn"
        │
        ├─ "a man against his father"
        ├─ "a daughter against her mother"
        ├─ "a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law"
        │
        └─► "A man's enemies will be
             the members of his own household"
            │
            └─► Quoting Micah 7:6
                Prophecy of end-times division
                │
                └─► The gospel doesn't unite families
                    It divides them
                    │
                    └─► Because it requires ULTIMATE allegiance
```

```
THE PRIORITY (vv. 37-39)
    │
    ├─ v. 37: COMPARATIVE LOVE
    │   │
    │   ├─ "Anyone who loves father or mother MORE than me
    │   │    is not worthy of me"
    │   │
    │   └─ "Anyone who loves son or daughter MORE than me
    │        is not worthy of me"
    │       │
    │       └─► Not: "don't love family"
    │           IS: "love Jesus MORE"
    │           │
    │           └─► Comparative, not absolute
    │               But still absolute priority
    │
    ├─ v. 38: CROSS-BEARING
    │   │
    │   └─► "Whoever does not take up their cross
    │        and follow me is not worthy of me"
    │       │
    │       └─► Cross = instrument of execution
    │           To carry your cross = walk to your death
    │           │
    │           └─► Following Jesus = dying to self
    │               Not metaphor, ACTUAL cost
    │
    └─ v. 39: LIFE PARADOX
        │
        ├─ "Whoever FINDS their life will LOSE it"
        │   └─► Preserve self → lose self
        │
        └─ "Whoever LOSES their life for my sake will FIND it"
            └─► Die to self → gain true life
                │
                └─► The upside-down kingdom
                    Loss = gain
                    Death = life
```

**The Family Conflict:**

```
BEFORE GOSPEL: Family unity
    │
    └─► One member believes → Division
        │
        ├─ Believer: Jesus > family
        └─ Family: "You've abandoned us"
            │
            └─► The sword has fallen
                │
                └─► Not because the gospel is mean
                    But because it demands supremacy
```

**Diagnostic:** *Who would I choose if forced to pick between Jesus and family?*

**One-line:** Jesus doesn't fit into your family—He demands to be first.

### 7. Receiving (vv. 40-42) — IDENTIFICATION

**Key insight:** To receive the sent ones is to receive the Sender.

```
THE IDENTIFICATION CHAIN (vv. 40-41)
    │
    ├─ "Anyone who welcomes YOU welcomes ME"
    │   └─► Disciples = Jesus' representatives
    │
    ├─ "Anyone who welcomes ME welcomes
    │    the ONE WHO SENT ME"
    │   └─► Jesus = Father's representative
    │
    └─► Therefore:
        │
        └─► Disciple → Jesus → Father
            │
            └─► To receive one = receive all
                To reject one = reject all
```

```
THE REWARD STRUCTURE (vv. 41-42)
    │
    ├─ "Whoever welcomes a PROPHET as a prophet
    │    will receive a PROPHET'S REWARD"
    │   └─► Receiving based on recognition
    │
    ├─ "Whoever welcomes a RIGHTEOUS PERSON
    │    will receive a RIGHTEOUS PERSON'S REWARD"
    │   └─► The reward matches the recognition
    │
    └─ "If anyone gives even a CUP OF COLD WATER
         to one of these little ones who is my disciple..."
        │
        └─► "That person will certainly not lose their reward"
            │
            └─► Even the SMALLEST act
                │
                └─► Cup of water = minimal hospitality
                    But done for "one of these little ones"
                    (disciples) = eternal significance
```

**The Reward Logic:**

| Act | Recognition | Reward |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Welcome prophet | As prophet | Prophet's reward |
| Welcome righteous | As righteous | Righteous reward |
| Give water | To disciple | Eternal reward |

```
THE PRINCIPLE
    │
    └─► Small acts + right motivation = eternal weight
        │
        └─► Not the SIZE of the act
            But the OBJECT of the act
            │
            └─► A cup of water given to a disciple
                = recognized by Jesus
                = rewarded by Father
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see serving Jesus' people as serving Jesus Himself?*

**One-line:** A cup of water for Jesus' sake carries eternal weight.

## Unified Framework

```
MATTHEW 10: THE SENT LIFE
    │
    ├─ DELEGATION: You carry Jesus' authority
    │   └─► Not your power, His through you
    │
    ├─ FOCUS: Strategic boundaries matter
    │   └─► Israel first, then all nations
    │
    ├─ EXPECTATION: Persecution is guaranteed
    │   └─► Sheep among wolves, student like teacher
    │
    ├─ COURAGE: Fear God, not man
    │   └─► He counts sparrows and hairs
    │
    ├─ LOYALTY: Public confession required
    │   └─► Your confession determines His
    │
    ├─ DIVISION: Gospel brings sword first
    │   └─► Jesus > family, cross-bearing, life paradox
    │
    └─ IDENTIFICATION: To receive you is to receive Jesus
        └─► Even a cup of water = eternal reward
```

**The Core Tension:**

```
SENT LIFE PARADOX
    │
    ├─ You have AUTHORITY → but go as SHEEP
    ├─ You bring PEACE → but cause DIVISION
    ├─ You face DEATH → but gain LIFE
    └─ You give WATER → but earn ETERNAL reward
        │
        └─► Upside-down kingdom
            Weakness = strength
            Loss = gain
            Suffering = glory
```

## Diagnostic Summary

| Section | Core Question |
|---------|---------------|
| Delegation | Do I see myself carrying Jesus' authority or my own ideas? |
| Focus | Am I strategically obedient or impulsively scattered? |
| Expectation | Am I surprised by hostility or do I expect it? |
| Courage | What am I more afraid of—man or God? |
| Loyalty | Have I publicly confessed Jesus? |
| Division | Who would I choose if forced to pick—Jesus or family? |
| Identification | Do I see serving Christians as serving Jesus? |

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Matthew 10:** Jesus sends His disciples with His authority to Israel, warning them to expect persecution, fear God not man, confess Him publicly, prioritize Him above family, and know that even a cup of water given in His name carries eternal weight.

## Personal Notes

### The Sheep-Wolves Paradigm

This isn't a strategy guide for winning. It's a survival guide for losing well.

```
EXPECTATION VS REALITY
    │
    ├─ I expected: "Go equipped to win"
    │
    └─► Jesus said: "Go as sheep to be eaten"
        │
        └─► But here's the thing:
            │
            └─► Sheep with Shepherd > Wolves without one
```

The entire chapter assumes vulnerability. Jesus doesn't arm us—He sends us defenseless. The only weapon: His name. The only protection: the Father's knowledge of every hair.

### The Family Sword

This is the hardest part for me. I want Jesus AND family peace. But v. 34 removes that option.

```
THE COST I FEEL
    │
    ├─ Before Jesus: Family unity (false peace)
    │
    └─ After Jesus: Family division (true position)
        │
        └─► Not because I chose division
            But because I chose Jesus
            │
            └─► The sword isn't in my hand
                It's in the gospel itself
```

Loving Jesus more than family doesn't mean hating family. It means being willing to lose them if the choice is forced. That's the cross (v. 38).

### The Cup of Water

v. 42 is the most hope-filled verse in the chapter for me.

```
ETERNAL WEIGHT FROM SMALL ACTS
    │
    └─► Cup of water = smallest hospitality
        │
        └─► Given to "one of these little ones"
            │
            └─► NOT LOST
                │
                └─► The Father tracks it
                    Jesus remembers it
                    Eternal reward attached
```

This means:
- The text you send to encourage a believer? Counted.
- The meal you make for someone struggling? Counted.
- The money you give to someone in ministry? Counted.

Not because THEY'RE important. Because HE is. The cup isn't for the person—it's for Jesus, through the person.

### Fear Recalibration

vv. 26-31 are a fear hierarchy. I fear the wrong things.

```
WHAT I FEAR
    │
    ├─ Man's opinion
    ├─ Man's rejection
    └─ Man's violence
        │
        └─► All temporary
            All limited to body
            All seen by God
```

```
WHAT I SHOULD FEAR
    │
    └─► The One who holds my soul
        │
        └─► But here's the paradox:
            │
            └─► The One I should fear
                is the One who counts my hairs
                │
                └─► Fear becomes trust
                    Terror becomes security
```

### The Confession Question

v. 32: "Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge before my Father."

```
HAVE I?
    │
    ├─ Privately: Yes
    ├─ In church: Yes
    │
    └─ At work? In my neighborhood? On social media?
        │
        └─► This is where the cost shows up
            │
            └─► Public confession = public target
                But also: public identification
                │
                └─► If I deny Him here
                    He denies me there
```

That's the stakes. Not "lose salvation" but "Jesus won't claim me before the Father." That's terrifying.

### The Life Paradox

v. 39: "Whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."

This is the whole chapter in one sentence.

```
THE LOGIC
    │
    ├─ Hold your life → lose it
    │   └─► Self-preservation = death
    │
    └─ Lose your life → find it
        └─► Self-sacrifice = life
            │
            └─► Not masochism
                Reorientation
                │
                └─► Life found in Him
                    not in self-protection
```

I keep trying to FIND life by protecting it. Jesus says that's how you LOSE it.

---

### Application

This chapter removes my categories:

- **Safe mission work** — No. Sheep among wolves.
- **Family + Jesus** — Not guaranteed. Might be Jesus OR family.
- **Secret discipleship** — Doesn't count. Public confession required.
- **Successful evangelism** — Not promised. Rejection expected.

What IS promised:
- Authority to do His work (v. 1)
- Spirit-given words under pressure (v. 20)
- Father's detailed care (vv. 29-31)
- Jesus' acknowledgment if I acknowledge Him (v. 32)
- Eternal reward for small acts (v. 42)

That's enough.
