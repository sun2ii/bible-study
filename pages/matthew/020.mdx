## The Three Movements

| Section | Focus | Core Principle |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Parable** (vv. 1-16) | Grace economics | Same pay for all = grace over merit |
| **Prediction & Request** (vv. 17-28) | Servant leadership | Glory through suffering, greatness through service |
| **Healing** (vv. 29-34) | Mercy given | Ask, receive, follow — grace in action |

## The Grace vs. Merit Architecture

```
LITERARY FRAME:
    │
    ├─ 19:30: "Many who are FIRST will be LAST,
    │          and many who are LAST will be FIRST"
    │   │
    │   └─► Sets up parable
    │
    ├─ PARABLE (20:1-15)
    │   │
    │   └─► Illustrates the principle
    │
    └─► 20:16: "So the LAST will be FIRST,
               and the FIRST will be LAST"
        │
        └─► Closes the frame
            │
            └─► INCLUSIO: Same statement brackets parable
                Chiastic structure emphasizes point

THE PROBLEM JESUS ADDRESSES:
    │
    └─► 19:27 - Peter asked:
        │
        └─► "We have LEFT everything...
             What will there be FOR US?"
            │
            └─► Merit-based thinking:
                │
                ├─ I gave X
                ├─ I deserve Y
                └─► Calculate my reward
                    │
                    └─► PARABLE CORRECTS:
                        │
                        └─► Kingdom ≠ merit system
                            Kingdom = grace system
                            │
                            └─► All receive SAME
                                Not based on hours worked
                                Based on owner's generosity

THE CHAPTER'S FLOW:
    │
    ├─ PARABLE (vv. 1-16):
    │   └─► Grace > Merit
    │       First workers = entitled
    │       Last workers = grateful
    │
    ├─ PASSION PREDICTION (vv. 17-19):
    │   └─► Jesus models grace
    │       Gives life for undeserving
    │       │
    │       └─► The ULTIMATE "last becoming first"
    │           King becomes servant
    │           Dies for rebels
    │
    ├─ JAMES & JOHN (vv. 20-28):
    │   └─► Disciples STILL don't get it
    │       Want positions of honor
    │       │
    │       └─► Jesus: "Great = servant"
    │           Merit-seeking exposed
    │           Service defined
    │
    └─► BLIND MEN (vv. 29-34):
        └─► Model of grace reception
            │
            ├─ No merit (blind, marginalized)
            ├─ Just ask: "Have MERCY"
            ├─ Receive freely
            └─► Follow gratefully
                │
                └─► Contrast with James/John:
                    │
                    ├─ J&J: "Grant us positions"
                    │   └─► Seeking honor
                    │
                    └─► Blind men: "Have mercy"
                        └─► Seeking grace
```

                        │
                        └─► DIFFERENT from first workers:

ELEVENTH HOUR - 5 PM (vv. 6-7)

    ├─ 3 PM:  Same
    └─► 5 PM:  Nothing mentioned
        │
        └─► DECREASING certainty
            INCREASING trust

                Last: faith
```

**The Payment (vv. 8-12):**

```
THE REVERSAL (v. 8)
    │
    └─► "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard

                    │
                    └─► Why this order?

                                    BUT last-to-first:
                                    First WATCH
                                    First EXPECT MORE
                                    First COMPLAIN

        └─► "So when those came who were hired first,
             they EXPECTED to receive MORE"

                │
                └─► Reasonable assumption (in merit system):

THE SINGLE THREAD:
    │
    └─► GRACE DISRUPTS MERIT
        │
        ├─ Parable: Same pay disrupts "I earned more"

        └─► Healing: Mercy disrupts "I have nothing to offer"
            │
            └─► Kingdom operates on GIFT, not WAGE
                │
