         Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
         'Go to the village ahead of you,
         and at once you will find a donkey tied there,
         with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.'"
        │
        └─► Geographical markers:

            │       Near Bethany
            │       │

                        │

    │       │
    │       └─► Pre-arranged (less likely)
    │
    ├─ "Untie them and bring"
    │   │
    │   └─► Taking someone's animals
    │       Normally = theft
    │       │
    │       BUT:
    │       │
    │       └─► Next verse...
    │

               say that the Lord needs them,
               and he will send them right away"

```

**Prophecy Fulfilled (vv. 4-5):**

```
THE CITATION (vv. 4-5)
    │
    └─► "This took place to fulfill
         what was spoken through the prophet:

         'Say to Daughter Zion,
          See, your king comes to you,
          gentle and riding on a donkey,
          and on a colt, the foal of a donkey'"
        │
        └─► Zechariah 9:9 quoted
            │
            └─► Original context:
                │
                └─► "Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!
                     Shout, Daughter Jerusalem!
                     See, your king comes to you,
                     RIGHTEOUS and VICTORIOUS,
                     LOWLY and riding on a donkey,
                     on a colt, the foal of a donkey"

KEY ELEMENTS:
    │
    ├─ "Your KING"
    │   └─► Not just prophet
    │       Not just teacher
    │       │
    │       KING
    │       │
    │       └─► Messianic claim
    │
    ├─ "GENTLE" (πραΰς)
    │   │
    │   └─► Same word: Matt 5:5 "Blessed are the meek"
    │       Matt 11:29 "I am gentle and humble"
    │       │
    │       └─► Not conquering warrior
    │           Humble servant
    │           │
    │           └─► But still KING
    │
    └─► "RIDING ON DONKEY"
        │
        └─► Why significant?
            │
            ├─ Kings in PEACE rode donkeys
            │   └─► 1 Kings 1:33: Solomon rode David's mule
            │       Judges 5:10: Leaders rode donkeys
            │
            └─► Kings in WAR rode horses
                │
                └─► Zech 9:10: "I will take away chariots...
                                 war-horse from Jerusalem...
                                 He will proclaim peace"
                    │
                    └─► Donkey = peace
                        Not military conquest (yet)
                        │
                        └─► First coming: peace, salvation
                            Second coming: war, judgment (Rev 19:11)

MATTHEW'S DETAIL:
    │
    └─► Matthew mentions BOTH:
        │
        ├─ Donkey (mother)
        └─► Colt (young one)
            │
            └─► Mark, Luke, John: only colt
                │
                └─► Why both?
                    │
                    └─► Poetic parallelism in Zechariah
                        "Donkey... colt, foal of donkey"
                        │
                        └─► Same animal, Hebrew poetry
                            Matthew emphasizes literal fulfillment
```

**The Entry (vv. 6-9):**

```
THE OBEDIENCE (vv. 6-7)
    │
    └─► "The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
         They brought the donkey and the colt
         and placed their cloaks on them
         for Jesus to sit on"
        │

    │
    └─► "A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
         while others cut branches from the trees
         and spread them on the road"
        │
        └─► Two actions:
            │
            ├─ CLOAKS on road
            │   │
            │   └─► 2 Kings 9:13 (same)

                      Question His

THE QUESTION: "By what AUTHORITY?"
    │
    └─► ἐξουσία (exousia)
        │
        └─► "Right, power, authority to act"
            │
            └─► "These things" = what?
                │
                ├─ Triumphal entry (accepting "Hosanna")
                ├─ Temple cleansing (driving out merchants)
                ├─ Teaching in courts (their jurisdiction)
                └─► Accepting children's praise

                        They demand: "Who authorized you?"

THEIR ASSUMPTION:
    │
    └─► Valid authority must come from:
        │
        ├─ Sanhedrin (them)
        │   └─► They give permission
        │       Or it's unauthorized
        │
        └─► If not from them, it's REBELLION
            │
            └─► John 7:48: "Have any of the rulers...
                            believed in him?"

**Jesus' Counter-Question (vv. 24-25):**

```
THE RESPONSE (v. 24)
    │
    └─► "Jesus replied, 'I will also ask you one question.
         If you answer me, I will tell you
         by what authority I am doing these things'"
        │
        └─► Rabbinic technique:
            Answer question with question
            │
            └─► But more than technique:
                Jesus TRAPS them
                │
                → Their answer will expose them

THE QUESTION (v. 25a)
    │
    └─► "'John's baptism—where did it come from?
          Was it from HEAVEN, or of HUMAN origin?'"
        │
        └─► Simple binary:
            │
            ├─ FROM HEAVEN (ἐξ οὐρανοῦ)
            │   └─► Divine authority
            │       God sent John
            │
            └─► OF HUMAN ORIGIN (ἐξ ἀνθρώπων)
                └─► Human invention
                    John = self-appointed
            │
            └─► No middle ground
                Must choose

WHY THIS QUESTION?
    │
    └─► Connection to Jesus' authority:
        │
        ├─ John baptized Jesus (Matt 3:13-17)
        │   └─► Voice from heaven: "This is my Son"
        │       │
        │       If John from heaven
        │       → John's testimony about Jesus = valid
        │       → Jesus' authority = from heaven
        │
        └─► John prepared way for Jesus
            │
            Mal 3:1: "I will send my messenger,
                      who will prepare the way before me"
            │
            → Can't accept John, reject Jesus
              Can't reject John, claim spiritual authority
```

**The Leaders' Dilemma (vv. 25b-27):**

```
THE DELIBERATION (vv. 25b-26)
    │
    └─► "They discussed it among themselves and said,
         'If we say, "From heaven,"
         he will ask, "Then why didn't you believe him?"
         But if we say, "Of human origin"—
         we are afraid of the people,
         for they all hold that John was a prophet'"
        │
        └─► The trap WORKS:
            │
            ├─ OPTION 1: "From heaven"
            │   │
            │   └─► Logical consequence:
            │       │
            │       └─► "Then why didn't you believe him?"
            │           │
            │           ├─ John said: "Behold, Lamb of God" (John 1:29)
            │           ├─ John pointed to Jesus
            │           └─► John's baptism = preparation for Messiah
            │               │
            │               If John from God
            │               → Should have believed John
            │               → Should have believed Jesus
            │               │
            │               EXPOSES: Their unbelief
            │
            └─► OPTION 2: "Of human origin"
                │
                └─► "We are afraid of the people"
                    │
                    └─► Political problem:
                        │
                        └─► "They all hold John was prophet"
                            │
                            └─► Matt 14:5: Herod "wanted to kill John,
                                            but afraid of people,
                                            because they considered him prophet"
                                │
                                → Leaders ALSO afraid
                                  Public opinion constrains them
                                │
                                If say "human origin"
                                → Crowd could riot
                                  Lose popular support
                                  │
                                  EXPOSES: Their cowardice
                                           Their political calculations

THE ANALYSIS:
    │
    └─► Leaders are trapped because:
        │
        ├─ Don't believe John (or Jesus)
        │   └─► Hearts = hard
        │
        ├─ Don't want to admit unbelief
        │   └─► Would expose spiritual blindness
        │
        └─► Don't want to lose popular support
            │
            └─► Care more about position than truth
                │
                → CANNOT answer honestly
```

**The Non-Answer (v. 27):**

```
THE EVASION (v. 27a)
    │
    └─► "So they answered Jesus, 'We don't know'"
        │
        └─► Οὐκ οἴδαμεν (Ouk oidamen)
            │
            └─► "We don't know"
                │
                ├─ NOT: "We're still studying it"
                └─► IS: Feigned ignorance
                    │
                    They DO know
                    │
                    └─► They rejected John
                        They know he claimed divine authority
                        │
                        But won't SAY it
                        │
                        → Dishonest evasion

THE RESULT (v. 27b)
    │
    └─► "Then he said, 'Neither will I tell you
         by what authority I am doing these things'"
        │
        └─► Οὐδὲ ἐγώ — "Neither I"
            │
            └─► Tit for tat?
                │
                NO.
                │
                └─► Jesus proves point:
                    │
                    ├─ They're not REALLY seeking truth
                    │   └─► If they were, they'd have answered
                    │       About John
                    │
                    ├─ They already KNOW the answer
                    │   └─► John and Jesus: both from heaven
                    │       But they reject both
                    │
                    └─► No point giving answer
                        │
                        When question is in bad faith
                        │
                        → John 3:19: "People loved darkness
                                      rather than light"
                        │
                        They don't WANT to know
                        They want to TRAP Him

THE EXPOSURE:
    │
    └─► Jesus exposes their:
        │
        ├─ Unbelief (rejected John)
        ├─ Dishonesty (won't admit it)
        ├─ Cowardice (fear the people)
        └─► Hardness (refuse truth when confronted)

### 5. Two Sons Parable (vv. 28-32) — REPENTANCE REVERSAL

**Key Greek:**
- μεταμέλομαι (metamelomai) — "change mind, regret"
- μετανοέω (metanoeō) — "repent, turn around"
- πόρνη (pornē) — "prostitute, harlot"

```
THE PARABLE (vv. 28-31a)
    │
    └─► "'What do you think?
         There was a man who had two sons.
         He went to the first and said,
         "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."

         "I will not," he answered,
         but later he changed his mind and went.

         Then the father went to the other son
         and said the same thing.
         He answered, "I will, sir,"
         but he did not go.

         Which of the two did what his father wanted?'

         'The first,' they answered"
        │
        └─► Simple parable, devastating point:

            ├─ SON #1:
            │   │
            │   └─► SAID: "I will NOT"

            │       ├─ Outright refusal
            │       ├─ Rebellion
            │       └─► Disrespectful
            │           │

            │           │
            │           └─► "Changed his mind" (μεταμεληθεὶς)
            │               │
            │               └─► μεταμέλομαι — "feel regret, change mind"
            │                   │
            │                   Different from μετανοέω (repent)
            │                   But similar result
            │                   │
            │                   → WENT to vineyard
            │                     DID the work
            │                     │
            │                     Actions > words

            └─► SON #2:
                │
                └─► SAID: "I will, sir" (Ἐγώ, κύριε)
                    │
                    ├─ Respectful
                    ├─ Compliant
                    └─► Immediate agreement
                        │
                        BUT:
                        │
                        └─► "Did NOT go" (οὐκ ἀπῆλθεν)
                            │
                            → Empty promise
                              No follow-through
                              │
                              Words ≠ actions

THE QUESTION: "Which did father's will?"
    │
    └─► "The first" (Ὁ πρῶτος)
        │
        └─► They answer correctly
            │
            → Condemn themselves
              (They're about to find out)

VARIANTS:
    │
    └─► Some manuscripts reverse sons
        │
        ├─ Some: First says yes, doesn't go
        │         Second says no, then goes
        │

### 6. Tenants Parable (vv. 33-46) — VIOLENT REJECTION

**Key Greek:**
- ἀμπελών (ampelōn) — "vineyard"
- γεωργός (geōrgos) — "farmer, tenant"
- κληρονομία (klēronomia) — "inheritance"
- ἀκρογωνιαῖος (akrogōniaios) — "cornerstone"

```
THE PARABLE SETUP (vv. 33-34)
    │
    └─► "'Listen to another parable:
         There was a LANDOWNER who planted a vineyard.
         He put a wall around it,
         dug a winepress in it
         and built a watchtower.
         Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers
         and moved to another place.
         When the harvest time approached,
         he sent his servants to the tenants
         to collect his fruit'"
        │
        └─► Isaiah 5:1-7 allusion:
            │
            └─► "My loved one had a vineyard...
                 He dug it up and cleared it of stones
                 and planted it with choicest vines.
                 He built a watchtower in it
                 and cut out a winepress as well...

                 The vineyard of the LORD Almighty
                 is the nation of Israel"
                │
                → Audience KNOWS this reference
                  Vineyard = Israel
                  Owner = God

DETAILS:
    │
    ├─ "Put a wall" — protection
    ├─ "Dug a winepress" — provision for harvest
    ├─ "Built a watchtower" — oversight
    │
    └─► Owner invested EVERYTHING
        Set up for success
        │
        → Then "moved to another place"
          │
          Gave tenants freedom to work
          Trusted them

"Sent servants to collect HIS fruit"
    │
    └─► Rightful claim
        His vineyard, his investment
        │
        Expects return
```

**Escalating Violence (vv. 35-39):**

```
FIRST WAVE (v. 35)
    │
    └─► "The tenants seized his servants;
         they beat one, killed another,
         and stoned a third"
        │
        └─► Three servants, three fates:
            │
            ├─ Beat (ἔδειραν)
            ├─ Killed (ἀπέκτειναν)
            └─► Stoned (ἐλιθοβόλησαν)
                │
                → Escalating brutality
                  Total rejection

SECOND WAVE (v. 36)
    │
    └─► "Then he sent other servants to them,
         more than the first time,
         and the tenants treated them the same way"
        │
        └─► Owner persists
            Sends MORE
            │
            Result: SAME violence
            │
            → Tenants are hardened
              Pattern of rejection

FINAL ATTEMPT (vv. 37-39)
    │
    ├─ The sending (v. 37):
    │   │
    │   └─► "Last of all, he sent his son to them.
    │        'They will respect my son,' he said"
    │       │
    │       └─► ὕστερον (hysteron) — "finally, last"
    │           │
    │           └─► After ALL servants rejected
    │               Owner sends SON
    │               │
    │               ├─ Father's reasoning: "Respect my son"
    │               │   │
    │               │   └─► Surely they'll honor son
    │               │       If not servants, at least heir
    │               │
    │               └─► Represents:
    │                   │
    │                   ├─ Servants = prophets (OT)
    │                   │   └─► Jeremiah beaten (Jer 20:2)
    │                   │       Zechariah stoned (2 Chr 24:21)
    │                   │       Isaiah sawn in two (tradition)
    │                   │       │
    │                   │       → Israel killed prophets
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Son = JESUS
    │                       │
    │                       Heb 1:1-2: "In past... through prophets...
    │                                   in these last days... through his Son"
    │
    ├─ The plot (v. 38):
    │   │
    │   └─► "But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other,
    │        'This is the HEIR.
    │        Come, let's KILL him and take his INHERITANCE'"
    │       │
    │       └─► Evil calculation:
    │           │
    │           ├─ "This is the HEIR" (κληρονόμος)
    │           │   │
    │           │   └─► They RECOGNIZE him
    │           │       Know who he is
    │           │       │
    │           │       → Not ignorance
    │           │         WILLFUL rejection
    │           │
    │           └─► "Kill him, take inheritance"
    │               │
    │               └─► Greedy logic:
    │                   │
    │                   ├─ Owner far away
    │                   ├─ Kill heir
    │                   └─► Vineyard becomes ours
    │                       │
    │                       → Delusional
    │                         Think they can steal from God
    │
    └─► The murder (v. 39):
        │
        └─► "So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard
             and killed him"
            │
            └─► Two-step murder:
                │
                ├─ "Threw him OUT of vineyard"
                │   │
                │   └─► Rejected, expelled
                │       Outside the vineyard
                │       │
                │       → Jesus: crucified OUTSIDE city
                │         Heb 13:12: "Jesus... suffered outside gate"
                │
                └─► "Killed him"
                    │
                    → Ultimate rejection
                      Murder the Son
```

**The Question & Answer (vv. 40-41):**

```
JESUS' QUESTION (v. 40)
    │
    └─► "Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes,
         what will he do to those tenants?"
        │
        └─► Forces them to pronounce judgment
            On themselves

THEIR ANSWER (v. 41)
    │
    └─► "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,"
         they replied,
         "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants,
         who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time"
        │
        └─► Two-part judgment:
            │
            ├─ DESTROY wicked tenants
            │   │
            │   └─► "Wretches to wretched end"
            │       κακοὺς κακῶς (kakous kakōs)
            │       │
            │       → Wordplay: "Evil ones evilly"
            │         Fitting punishment
            │
            └─► TRANSFER vineyard to others
                │
                └─► "Who will give him share of crop"
                    │
                    → New tenants will be FAITHFUL
                      Produce fruit
                      │
                      Give owner his due

THEY DON'T REALIZE:
    │
    └─► They just condemned THEMSELVES
        │
        ├─ They are the wicked tenants
        ├─ Vineyard = kingdom
        └─► Will be given to others
            │
            → Self-condemnation
```

**Scripture Fulfillment (vv. 42-44):**

```
THE CORNERSTONE (v. 42)
    │
    └─► "Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures:

         "The stone the builders rejected
          has become the cornerstone;
          the Lord has done this,
          and it is marvelous in our eyes"?'"
        │
        └─► Psalm 118:22-23 quoted
            │
            └─► Same psalm as triumphal entry:
                Ps 118:25-26: "LORD, save us!...
                               Blessed is he who comes
                               in the name of the LORD"

        │                   the builders, which has become
        │                   the cornerstone"
        │
        ├─ "Builders" = religious leaders
        │   │
        │   └─► Those who should build God's house
        │       But they REJECT the foundation stone
        │
        └─► "Has become CORNERSTONE" (κεφαλὴν γωνίας)

            └─► "Head of the corner"
                │

                ├─ Holds structure together

                    │
                    → Jesus: foundation of God's true temple
                      │
                      Eph 2:20: "Built on foundation...

                                 as chief cornerstone"

THE IRONY:
    │
    └─► Builders REJECTED the very stone
        That becomes MOST IMPORTANT
        │
        → "The Lord has done this"
          God's plan all along
          │
          Their rejection → His exaltation

            │                       Many... will stumble;

**The Leaders' Response (vv. 45-46):**

```
RECOGNITION (v. 45)
    │
    └─► "When the chief priests and the Pharisees
         heard Jesus' parables,
         they knew he was talking about THEM"
        │
        └─► ἔγνωσαν (egnōsan) — "they knew, recognized"
            │
            → Crystal clear
              │
              ├─ Wicked tenants = them
              ├─ Killed prophets = their fathers did
              ├─ Will kill son = they will
              └─► Kingdom taken away = from them
                  │
                  → No ambiguity
                    Direct confrontation

INTENT (v. 46a)
    │
    └─► "They looked for a way to ARREST him"
        │
        └─► ἐζήτησαν (ezētēsan) — "they sought"
            │
            κρατῆσαι (kratēsai) — "to seize, arrest"
            │
            → Immediate response: Violence
              │
              Not: "Let's repent"
              Not: "Is he right?"
              │
              IS: "Arrest him"
              │
              → Proving the parable TRUE
                They ARE the wicked tenants
                About to kill the Son

RESTRAINT (v. 46b)
    │
    └─► "But they were afraid of the CROWD
         because the people held that he was a PROPHET"
        │
        └─► ἐφοβήθησαν (ephobēthēsan) — "they feared"
            │
            → Second time: fear of people
              │
              v. 26: Feared to say John "of human origin"
              v. 46: Fear to arrest Jesus
              │
              → Political calculations
                Not truth-seeking
                │
                "People held him as prophet"
                │
                └─► Public opinion restrains them
                    For now
                    │
                    But they will act
                    When crowd turns (ch 27)

THE SINGLE THREAD: AUTHORITY & FRUIT
    │
    ├─ WHO HAS AUTHORITY?
    │   │
    │   ├─ Jesus claims: FROM HEAVEN
    │   │   └─► Entry: fulfills prophecy
    │   │       Cleansing: acts as Lord of temple
    │   │       Cursing: judges like God
    │   │       Parables: speaks as vineyard owner
    │   │
    │   └─► Leaders claim: FROM TRADITION
    │       └─► "By what authority do you...?"
    │           But won't answer about John
    │           Trapped by their unbelief

    ├─ WHAT PROVES AUTHORITY?
    │   │
    │   └─► FRUIT
    │       │
    │       ├─ Fig tree: No fruit → cursed
    │       ├─ Two sons: Obedience (fruit) > profession
    │       └─► Tenants: No fruit → kingdom taken
    │           │
    │           → Authority validated by FRUIT

    │
    └─► RESULT:
        │
        └─► KINGDOM TRANSFERRED
            │
            ├─ FROM: Israel's leaders
            │   └─► Fruitless tenants
            │       Rejected prophets

                    │
                    → The great inversion:

## Application Questions

### The Humble King (vv. 1-11)

**The Pattern of Expectation vs. Reality:**

The crowds welcomed Jesus as Messianic King (Ps 118, Zech 9:9), but within a week turned to "Crucify him!" Why? He didn't match their expectations of political deliverance from Rome.

**Questions to consider:**
- What expectations about Jesus or God's kingdom might be culturally conditioned rather than biblical?
- How does Jesus' choice of a donkey (peace) vs. war-horse (conquest) reframe what kind of King he is?
- Where might religious or political nationalism distort genuine faith?
- What happens when God doesn't act according to human expectations?

### The Cleansed Temple (vv. 12-17)

**What Provoked Jesus' Fury:**
- Money changers exploiting worshippers through exchange rates
- Dove sellers price-gouging the poor (Lev 12:8)
- Court of Gentiles turned from "house of prayer for all nations" (Isa 56:7) into marketplace
- Using religion for financial profit = "den of robbers" (Jer 7:11)

**The Double Pattern:**
1. Jesus drives out exploiters (righteous anger)
2. Jesus welcomes and heals the broken (tender mercy)

**Questions to consider:**
- What are modern equivalents of commercializing worship or using religious activity for personal gain?
- How does Jesus show both fierce opposition to exploitation and compassionate welcome to the vulnerable?
- What's the significance of children praising (Ps 8:2) while religious leaders oppose?
- What does it mean that God's house should be "house of prayer for all nations"?

### The Withered Fig Tree (vv. 18-22)

**The Symbolism:**
- Fig tree = Israel (Jer 8:13, Hos 9:10)
- Leaves = outward religion (temple, rituals, traditions)
- No fruit = no righteousness (justice, mercy, faithfulness)
- Withering = judgment (AD 70 temple destruction)

**The Warning of Matt 7:21-23:**
Possible to have ministry, miracles, and religious activity ("Lord, Lord!") yet still be rejected because of no genuine fruit or relationship.

**Questions to consider:**
- What's the difference between "leaves" (religious appearance) and "fruit" (Gal 5:22-23)?
- How does the fig tree incident connect to the temple cleansing before it?
- What does Jesus' teaching on faith/prayer (vv. 21-22) have to do with the cursed tree?
- What would it mean to have outward religion but lack actual righteousness?

### The Authority Question (vv. 23-27)

**The Leaders' Trap:**
They ask "By what authority?" but aren't genuinely seeking truth—they want to trap Jesus. When He counters with "Was John's baptism from heaven or human?" they can't answer honestly because:
- Saying "from heaven" exposes their unbelief in John (and Jesus)
- Saying "of human origin" risks the crowd's anger

So they claim "We don't know"—feigned ignorance to avoid submission.

**Questions to consider:**
- What's the difference between questions asked to learn vs. questions asked to evade?
- How does Jesus' counter-question expose their bad faith?
- What does it mean to ask "I don't know" when you actually do know but won't submit?
- Are there ways people use intellectual questions as shields against obedience?

### The Two Sons (vv. 28-32)

**The Parable:**
- Son #1: Said "No" to father, but later changed mind and obeyed (tax collectors/prostitutes)
- Son #2: Said "Yes" to father, but never actually went (religious leaders)

**Which son did the father's will?** The first—because actions matter more than words.

**The Scandal:**
"Tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you" (v. 31)—not because they were morally superior, but because they actually repented when John preached. The religious leaders saw this repentance but still didn't believe (v. 32).

**Questions to consider:**
- What's the relationship between profession and obedience?
- Why does actual repentance (changed actions) matter more than religious credentials?
- How does James 1:22 ("Do not merely listen... do what it says") relate to this parable?
- What does it mean that despised sinners entered "ahead of" (not "instead of") the religious leaders?

### The Wicked Tenants (vv. 33-46)

**The Parable Structure:**
- Owner plants vineyard with everything needed (wall, winepress, watchtower = complete provision)
- Rents to tenants, expects fruit at harvest
- Sends servants → beaten, killed, stoned (= OT prophets)
- Sends son → murdered outside vineyard (= Jesus, crucified outside Jerusalem, Heb 13:12)
- Owner will destroy tenants, give vineyard to others

**The Cornerstone (Ps 118:22-23):**
The stone the builders rejected became the cornerstone—Jesus is both the foundation stone that causes stumbling (v. 44, Isa 8:14-15) and the crushing judgment stone (Dan 2:34-35).

**The Transfer (v. 43):**
"The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit." This isn't about losing salvation but about kingdom stewardship—opportunity given to fruit-bearers.

**Questions to consider:**
- What does it mean that God invested "everything" but the tenants produced nothing?
- How does the escalation (servants → son) show God's patience and their hardness?
- What's the relationship between rejecting God's messengers and rejecting His authority?
- What does v. 44 mean: "falls on stone" vs. "stone falls on you"?

### Chapter Synthesis

**Central Theme: Authority**
Every section in Matthew 21 addresses the question of authority:
- Entry (vv. 1-11): Jesus claims Messianic authority
- Cleansing (vv. 12-17): Asserts authority over temple
- Cursing (vv. 18-22): Exercises authority to judge
- Challenge (vv. 23-27): Confronts human authority claims
- Parables (vv. 28-46): Warns about rejecting heaven's authority

**The Pattern:**
Those who submit to Jesus' authority gain the kingdom; those who reject it lose everything (v. 43).

**Narrative Progression:**
- Ch 18-20: Private preparation of disciples
- Ch 21: Public confrontation with leaders
- The King arrives → conflict erupts

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What proves genuine authority: position/credentials or fruit/obedience?
2. How do the parables distinguish between profession and actual repentance?
3. What does it mean to have "leaves" (religious appearance) without "fruit" (righteousness)?
4. Why are tax collectors and prostitutes entering ahead of religious leaders?
5. What's the warning in the transfer of the kingdom to "fruit-bearing people"?
