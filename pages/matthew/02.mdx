# Matthew 2 - The King's Reception

> Two responses to the King reveal that proximity to truth doesn't guarantee reception. The religious experts knew the address but never visited; pagan astrologers traveled a thousand miles to worship. This chapter warns: you can be geographically close to Jesus and spiritually far away. The issue isn't information—it's the heart's response.

TWO RESPONSES TO THE KING

MAGI (Gentile outsiders)          HEROD (Jewish king)
    │                                  │
    ├─ Traveled far                    ├─ Already in Jerusalem
    ├─ Sought to worship               ├─ Sought to kill
    ├─ Followed the star               ├─ Consulted scholars
    ├─ Brought treasures               ├─ Brought deception
    └─ Found Jesus                     └─ Lost everything
```

### The Gifts

|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Gold** | Royalty, wealth | King |
| **Frankincense** | Priestly incense, prayer | Priest / God |

### One-Line Cut

## Jesus Relives Israel's Story

```
ISRAEL                          JESUS
    │                               │
    ├─ Called God's "son"           ├─ The true Son of God
    ├─ Went down to Egypt           ├─ Fled to Egypt
    ├─ Called out of Egypt          ├─ Called out of Egypt
    ├─ Passed through water         ├─ Baptism (ch. 3)
    ├─ Tested 40 years (failed)     ├─ Tested 40 days (succeeds)
    └─ Received Law on mountain     └─ Gives Law on mountain

JESUS = The True Israel who succeeds where Israel failed
```

### One-Line Cut
**The King of the Jews grows up in a town so insignificant it becomes an insult - "Nazarene."**
