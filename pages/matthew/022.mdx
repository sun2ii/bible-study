## The Four Movements

| Section | Focus | Core Principle |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Parable: Wedding Feast** (vv. 1-14) | Invitation ignored, rejected | Grace offered to all; response determines inclusion |
| **Three Test Questions** (vv. 15-40) | Trap attempts fail | True wisdom navigates false dilemmas |
| **Jesus' Counter-Question** (vv. 41-46) | Christ's identity | Messiah transcends human categories |
| **Result** | Leaders silenced | Truth defeats manipulation |

## The Confrontation Architecture

```
CHAPTER 21 ENDS:
    │
    └─► TENANTS PARABLE (21:33-46)
        │
        └─► Kingdom taken from leaders
            Given to fruit-bearing people
            Leaders know He speaks of them
            Want to arrest, fear crowd
            │
            CHAPTER 22 OPENS:
            │
            └─► WEDDING FEAST PARABLE
                │
                └─► Same theme: rejection
                    │
                    ├─ Invited guests REFUSE
                    ├─ Kill messengers
                    └─► Replaced by street people
                        │
                        BUT:
                        │
                        └─► Even "in" people can be "out"
                            Wedding garment required
                            │
                            "Many invited, few chosen"

THE TRAP SEQUENCE:
    │
    ├─ PHARISEES + HERODIANS (vv. 15-22)
    │   └─► Political trap: Caesar's tax
    │       │
    │       ├─ Say "Yes" → Lose Jewish support
    │       └─► Say "No" → Charge with treason
    │           │
    │           Jesus' answer: Transcends trap
    │           "Give both Caesar and God their due"
    │
    ├─ SADDUCEES (vv. 23-33)
    │   └─► Theological trap: Resurrection absurdity
    │       │
    │       Present ridiculous scenario
    │       (Seven brothers, one wife)
    │       │
    │       Jesus' answer: Exposes ignorance
    │       "You don't understand Scripture or power"
    │       │
    │       God of Abraham = God of LIVING
    │
    └─► PHARISEES (vv. 34-40)
        └─► Legal trap: Rank commandments
            │
            613 commands in Torah
            Which is GREATEST?
            │
            Jesus' answer: Two-tier hierarchy
            │
            ├─ First: Love God (vertical)
            └─► Second: Love neighbor (horizontal)
                │
                "All Law hangs on these"
```

```
THE REVERSAL: JESUS QUESTIONS THEM
    │
    └─► vv. 41-46: JESUS ASKS
        │
        └─► "Whose son is the Messiah?"
            │
            ├─ They answer: "David's son"
            │   └─► Correct... but incomplete
            │
            └─► Jesus: "Then why David call him 'Lord'?"
                │
                Psalm 110:1:
                "The LORD said to my Lord:
                 'Sit at my right hand...'"
                │
                └─► If Messiah is David's SON,
                    why does David call him LORD?
                    │
                    ├─ SON = descendant, inferior
                    └─► LORD = superior, divine
                        │
                        ANSWER: Messiah is both
                        │
                        └─► Fully human (David's son)
                            Fully divine (David's Lord)
                            │
                            NO ONE could answer
                            │
                            From that day:
                            "No one dared ask any more questions"
```

```
THE THREAD: WHAT DO YOU OWE?
    │
    ├─ TO KING (vv. 1-14)
    │   └─► Wedding feast invitation
    │       │
    │       ├─ Owe: RESPONSE to invitation
    │       └─► Consequence: Rejection = judgment
    │           Acceptance = must wear proper garment
    │           │
    │           → Can't ignore OR presume
    │
    ├─ TO CAESAR (vv. 15-22)
    │   └─► Imperial tax
    │       │
    │       └─► Owe: What bears Caesar's image
    │           (The coin)
    │           │
    │           → Civil obligations valid
    │
    ├─ TO GOD (vv. 15-22)
    │   └─► Everything that bears God's image
    │       │
    │       └─► Humans bear God's image (Gen 1:27)
    │           │
    │           → Give YOURSELF to God
    │             Not just taxes/tithes
    │
    ├─ TO GOD (vv. 34-40)
    │   └─► Greatest commandment
    │       │
    │       └─► Owe: Total love
    │           │

## Section Analysis

### 1. Wedding Banquet (vv. 1-14) — GRACE REJECTED

**Key Greek:**
- γάμος (gamos) — "wedding, wedding feast"
- ἕτοιμος (hetoimos) — "ready, prepared"
- ἔνδυμα (endyma) — "clothing, garment"
- κλητός (klētos) — "called, invited"
- ἐκλεκτός (eklektos) — "chosen, elect"

```
THE SETUP (vv. 1-2)
    │
    └─► "Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
         'The kingdom of heaven is like a king
         who prepared a wedding banquet for his son'"
        │
        └─► Continuity: "again in parables"
            │
            ├─ Ch 21: Two sons, Wicked tenants
            └─► Ch 22: Wedding feast
                │
                Same audience: chief priests, Pharisees
                │
                → Escalating warnings

"WEDDING BANQUET" (γάμος)
    │
    └─► Royal wedding = major event
        │
        ├─ For KING'S SON
        │   └─► Most important celebration
        │       Greatest honor to attend
        │
        └─► In Jewish context:
            │
            └─► Messianic banquet imagery
                │
                Isa 25:6: "LORD... will prepare
                          a feast of rich food for all peoples"
                │
                Luke 14:16-24: Similar parable
                (Great banquet)
                │
                Rev 19:9: "Wedding supper of the Lamb"
                │
                → Kingdom = feast
                  Messiah = bridegroom
```

**First Invitation (vv. 3-6):**

```
SERVANTS SENT (v. 3)
    │
    └─► "He sent his servants to those
         who had been INVITED to the banquet
         to tell them to come,
         but they REFUSED to come"
        │
        └─► Already invited (κεκλημένους)
            │
            └─► Perfect tense: previously invited
                Standing invitation
                │
                NOT: first-time offer
                IS: Follow-up, "Dinner's ready"
                │
                → Israel = pre-invited
                  Through covenant
                  Through prophets
                  │
                  Now: final call
                  │
                  BUT: "They refused" (οὐκ ἤθελον)
                       │
                       → Willful rejection
                         Not: "couldn't come"
                         IS: "wouldn't come"

SECOND ATTEMPT (vv. 4-5)
    │
    └─► "Then he sent some more servants and said,
         'Tell those who have been invited
         that I have prepared my dinner:
         My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered,
         and everything is ready.
         Come to the wedding banquet.'

         But they paid no attention
         and went off—
         one to his field, another to his business"
        │
        └─► King's persistence:
            │
            ├─ Sends MORE servants
            ├─ Emphasizes: "EVERYTHING ready"
            │   │
            │   └─► ἕτοιμα (hetoima) — "ready"
            │       │
            │       Oxen butchered
            │       Feast prepared
            │       │
            │       → No excuse left
            │         Total preparation
            │
            └─► Their response: "Paid no attention"
                │
                ἀμελήσαντες (amelēsantes)
                │
                └─► "Neglected, disregarded, treated as nothing"
                    │
                    Not: hostile rejection (yet)
                    IS: Indifference
                    │
                    "One to field, another to business"
                    │
                    → Priorities elsewhere
                      Too busy for king's feast
                      │
                      Luke 14:18-20: Similar excuses
                      "I have bought field..."
                      "I have bought oxen..."
                      "I just got married..."
                      │
                      → THEIR concerns > KING'S invitation

ESCALATION TO VIOLENCE (v. 6)
    │
    └─► "The rest seized his servants,
         mistreated them and killed them"
        │
        └─► From indifference to MURDER
            │
            ├─ Some: ignored invitation
            └─► Others: attacked messengers
                │
                Parallel to 21:35-36:
                Tenants beat, killed servants
                │
                → Same pattern:
                  Prophets sent
                  Prophets rejected
                  Prophets killed
```

**The King's Judgment (v. 7):**

```
WRATH UNLEASHED (v. 7)
    │
    └─► "The king was enraged.
         He sent his army and destroyed those murderers
         and burned their city"
        │
        └─► ὠργίσθη (ōrgisthē) — "was angry, enraged"
            │
            → Righteous anger
              │
              ├─ Servants killed
              ├─- Invitation scorned
              └─► Honor of son insulted
                  │
                  RESPONSE:
                  │
                  ├─ "Sent his ARMY" (στρατεύματα)
                  │   │
                  │   Not: more servants
                  │   IS: Military force
                  │
                  ├─ "Destroyed those MURDERERS"
                  │   │
                  │   → Justice for killing messengers
                  │
                  └─► "Burned their CITY"
                      │
                      → Total destruction

HISTORICAL REFERENCE?
    │
    └─► AD 70: Rome destroyed Jerusalem
        │
        ├─ City burned
        ├─- Temple demolished
        └─► Nation scattered
            │
            → Parable prophetic?
              │
              OR: Standard judgment imagery?
              │
              Either way: Rejection = destruction
```

**New Guests (vv. 8-10):**

```
THE REPLACEMENT (vv. 8-9)
    │
    └─► "Then he said to his servants,
         'The wedding banquet is ready,
         but those I invited did not deserve to come.
         So go to the street corners
         and invite to the banquet ANYONE you find'"
        │
        └─► Feast still ready
            │
            But original guests: "did not deserve" (ἄξιοι)
            │
            NOT: "not worthy enough"
            IS: "proved themselves unworthy"
                 │
                 By rejection + murder
            │
            NEW INSTRUCTION:
            │
            └─► "Street corners" (διεξόδους τῶν ὁδῶν)
                │
                "Exits of the roads"
                = Crossroads, public places
                │
                "ANYONE you find" (ὅσους ἐὰν εὕρητε)
                │
                → No discrimination
                  No pre-qualification
                  │
                  ALL are invited
                  │
                  ├─ Not: elite only

                      │
                      → Radical inclusion

THE GATHERING (v. 10)
    │
    └─► "So the servants went out into the streets
         and gathered ALL the people they could find,
         the BAD as well as the GOOD,
         and the wedding hall was filled with guests"
        │
        └─► πονηρούς τε καὶ ἀγαθούς
            │
            "Both evil and good"
            │
            └─► Moral spectrum included
                │
                Not: only righteous invited
                IS: All kinds
                │
                ├─ Bad (πονηρούς) — wicked, evil
                └─► Good (ἀγαθούς) — morally good
                    │
                    Both welcomed
                    │
                    → Grace to all
                      │
                      "Wedding hall FILLED"
                      │
                      King's purpose accomplished
                      Different guests, same feast
```

**Wedding Garment (vv. 11-13):**

```
THE INSPECTION (v. 11)
    │
    └─► "But when the king came in to see the guests,
         he noticed a man there
         who was NOT wearing wedding clothes"
        │
        └─► King enters to inspect
            │
            Finds: οὐκ ἐνδεδυμένον ἔνδυμα γάμου
            │
            "Not clothed with wedding garment"
            │
            → Problem: improper dress

WHAT IS "WEDDING GARMENT"?
    │
    ├─ LITERAL reading:
    │   │
    │   └─► Custom: Host provides garments?
    │       │
    │       Some traditions: King gave robes
    │       │
    │       → Refusing garment = insult
    │         Man had access, chose not to wear
    │
    └─► SYMBOLIC reading:
        │
        └─► Wedding garment = righteousness
            │
            Isa 61:10: "He has clothed me with garments of salvation
                        and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness"
            │
            Rev 19:8: "Fine linen... is the righteous acts of saints"
            │
            → Entering kingdom requires:
              │
              ├─ Invitation (grace)
              └─► Proper clothing (righteousness from God)
                  │
                  Can't come on own terms
                  Must accept God's provision

THE CONFRONTATION (v. 12)
    │
    └─► "He asked, 'How did you get in here
         without wedding clothes, friend?'
         The man was SPEECHLESS"
        │
        └─► King's question: "How?" (Πῶς)
            │
            "Friend" (ἑταῖρε) — ironic?
            │
            Or: genuine sadness?
            │
            THE RESPONSE:
            │
            └─► ἐφιμώθη (ephimōthē)
                │
                "Was silenced, muzzled"
                │
                Same word: Matt 22:34 "Sadducees silenced"
                │
                → No defense
                  No excuse
                  │
                  Caught without proper covering

THE EXPULSION (v. 13)
    │
    └─► "Then the king told the attendants,
         'Tie him hand and foot,
         and throw him outside,
         into the DARKNESS,
         where there will be WEEPING and GNASHING of teeth'"
        │
        └─► Severe judgment:
            │
            ├─ "Tie hand and foot"
            │   └─► Bound, helpless
            │
            ├─ "Throw outside"
            │   └─► Expelled from feast
            │       Outside = exclusion
            │
            ├─- "DARKNESS" (σκότος)
            │   │
            │   └─► Feast = light, joy
            │       Outside = dark, alone
            │
            └─► "Weeping and gnashing"
                │
                κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς
                │
                → Grief + rage
                  Sorrow at loss
                  Anger at self
                  │
                  Matt 8:12; 13:42,50; 24:51; 25:30
                  │
                  Standard judgment language

THE WARNING:
    │
    └─► Being "in" doesn't guarantee staying in
        │
        ├─ Man WAS at feast
        └─► But: improper dress = ejected
            │
            → Presumption condemned
              Must have both:
              │
              ├─ Invitation (grace)
              └─► Garment (righteousness)
```

**The Conclusion (v. 14):**

```
THE SUMMARY (v. 14)
    │
    └─► "For many are INVITED,
         but few are CHOSEN"
        │
        └─► πολλοὶ γάρ εἰσιν κλητοὶ ὀλίγοι δὲ ἐκλεκτοί
            │
            ├─ κλητοὶ (klētoi) — "called, invited"
            │   │
            │   └─► Many receive invitation
            │       Gospel goes to all
            │       │
            │       "Many" not "all"?
            │       Or: "many" = large number?
            │
            └─► ἐκλεκτοί (eklektoi) — "chosen, elect"
                │
                └─► Fewer actually chosen
                    │
                    Why?
                    │
                    ├─ Some refuse invitation (vv. 3-5)
                    ├─ Some attack messengers (v. 6)
                    └─► Some accept but lack garment (vv. 11-13)
                        │
                        → Three ways to miss feast:
                          │
                          1. Reject invitation (open rebellion)
                          2. Kill messengers (violent opposition)
                          3. Come improperly (presumption)

THEOLOGICAL TENSION:
    │
    ├─ Invitation = God's sovereign call
    │   └─► Yet: Can be refused
    │       (Human responsibility)
    │
    └─► Election = God's sovereign choice
        └─► Yet: Connected to response
            (Not arbitrary)
            │
            → Mystery of divine sovereignty + human response
              Both affirmed, not resolved
```

### 2. Imperial Tax (vv. 15-22) — DUAL CITIZENSHIP

**Key Greek:**
- κῆνσος (kēnsos) — "poll tax, census tax"
- δηνάριον (dēnarion) — "denarius" (Roman coin)
- εἰκών (eikōn) — "image, likeness"
- ἐπιγραφή (epigraphē) — "inscription"

```
THE PLOT (v. 15)
    │
    └─► "Then the Pharisees went out
         and laid plans to TRAP him in his words"
        │
        └─► συμβούλιον ἔλαβον (symboulion elabon)
            │
            "Took counsel together"
            │
            → Deliberate conspiracy
              Not: spontaneous question
              IS: Calculated trap
              │
              ὅπως αὐτὸν παγιδεύσωσιν
              │
              "In order to ensnare him"
              │
              παγιδεύω (pagideuō) — "trap, catch"
              │
              → Like animal in snare
                One wrong word = captured
```

**Strange Alliance (v. 16a):**

```
THE DELEGATION (v. 16a)
    │
    └─► "They sent their disciples to him
         along with the HERODIANS"
        │
        └─► Two groups:
            │
            ├─ PHARISEES' disciples
            │   │
            │   └─► Strict Jews
            │       Oppose Roman rule
            │       │
            │       Want: Jewish independence
            │       Theological conservatives
            │
            └─► HERODIANS
                │
                └─► Supporters of Herod
                    (Roman puppet king)
                    │
                    Collaborate with Rome
                    │
                    Want: Roman stability
                    Political pragmatists

IRONY:
    │
    └─► Natural enemies unite
        │
        To destroy common threat: Jesus
        │
        → Politics makes strange bedfellows
          │
          Luke 23:12: "Herod and Pilate became friends...
                       before they had been enemies"
```

**The Flattery (v. 16b):**

```
BUTTERING UP (v. 16b)
    │
    └─► "Teacher," they said,
         "we know that you are a man of INTEGRITY
         and that you teach the way of God
         in accordance with the TRUTH.
         You aren't swayed by others,
         because you pay no attention to who they are"
        │
        └─► Four claims:
            │
            ├─ "Man of INTEGRITY" (ἀληθής)
            │   │
            │   └─► "Truthful, honest"
            │       Can't be fooled
            │
            ├─- "Teach way of God in TRUTH" (ἀλήθεια)
            │   │
            │   └─► Accurate teacher
            │       No false doctrine
            │
            ├─- "Not swayed by others"
            │   │
            │   └─► οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός
            │       "You don't care about anyone"
            │       │
            │       → Fearless
            │         Won't be intimidated
            │
            └─► "Pay no attention to who they are"
                │
                └─► οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον
                    │
                    "Don't look at face/person"
                    │
                    No favoritism
                    No respect of persons
                    │
                    → Impartial

THE IRONY:
    │
    └─► Everything they say = TRUE
        │
        But: Said to manipulate
        │
        → Flattery before trap
          "Since you're SO honest and fearless...
           answer THIS..."
          │
          Setting him up
```

**The Trap Question (v. 17):**

```
THE DILEMMA (v. 17)
    │
    └─► "Tell us then, what is your opinion?
         Is it RIGHT to pay the imperial tax to Caesar
         or not?"
        │
        └─► "Imperial tax" (κῆνσος)
            │
            └─► Latin: census
                │
                Poll tax
                │
                Every person pays annually
                To Caesar
                │
                Introduced: AD 6
                │
                Sparked: Judas of Galilee's revolt
                (Acts 5:37)
                │
                → Hated symbol of Roman occupation

THE HORNS OF DILEMMA:
    │
    ├─ SAY "YES, pay tax":
    │   │
    │   └─► Consequences:
    │       │
    │       ├─ Lose Jewish support
    │       │   └─► Seen as collaborator
    │       │       Traitor to Israel
    │       │       │
    │       │       Pharisees turn crowd against him
    │       │
    │       └─► Undermines Messianic claim
    │           │
    │           └─► True Messiah would liberate
    │               Not submit to Rome
    │
    └─► SAY "NO, don't pay":
        │
        └─► Consequences:
            │
            ├─ Herodians report to Rome
            │   └─► Charge: Sedition
            │       Inciting tax revolt
            │       │
            │       Roman response: Crucifixion
            │
            └─► Validates later charges
                │
                Luke 23:2: "Forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar"
                │
                → Death sentence

PERFECT TRAP:
    │
    └─► Either answer = destroyed
        │
        ├─ Say yes → Religious ruin
        └─► Say no → Political execution
            │
            → No escape (they think)
```

**Jesus' Exposure (vv. 18-19):**

```
SEEING THROUGH IT (v. 18)
    │
    └─► "But Jesus, knowing their EVIL INTENT, said,
         'You hypocrites, why are you trying to TRAP me?'"
        │
        └─► γνοὺς... τὴν πονηρίαν αὐτῶν
            │
            "Knowing their wickedness"
            │
            → Not fooled
              Sees hearts
              │
              "Hypocrites" (ὑποκριταί)
              │
              "Actors, pretenders"
              │
              → Flattery exposed
                "You say I'm honest...
                 while trying to trap me?"
                │
                "Why TRAP me?" (πειράζετε)
                │
                Same word: Satan's temptation (4:1,3)
                │
                → Demonic plot

THE REQUEST (v. 19)
    │
    └─► "Show me the coin used for paying the tax."
         They brought him a denarius"
        │
        └─► Brilliant move:
            │
            └─► Makes THEM produce coin
                │
                Not: Jesus pulls out coin
                │
                → They have it
                  They use it
                  │
                  Already participating in Roman economy
                  │
                  Hypocrisy exposed further
```

**The Answer (vv. 20-21):**

```
THE QUESTION (v. 20)
    │
    └─► "And he asked them,
         'Whose IMAGE is this?
         And whose INSCRIPTION?'"
        │
        └─► εἰκών (eikōn) — "image"
            ἐπιγραφή (epigraphē) — "inscription"
            │
            On denarius:
            │
            ├─ Image: Caesar's head
            │   └─► Tiberius Caesar
            │
            └─► Inscription:
                │
                "TI CAESAR DIVI AVG F AUGUSTUS"
                │
                "Tiberius Caesar, son of divine Augustus"
                │
                → Blasphemous to Jews
                  Claims divinity
                  Graven image (Exod 20:4)

THEIR ANSWER (v. 21a)
    │
    └─► "'Caesar's,' they replied"
        │
        └─► Simple admission
            Coin = Caesar's
            │
            Bears his image
            His inscription
            │
            → His property

THE SOLUTION (v. 21b)
    │
    └─► "Then he said to them,
         'So give back to Caesar what is Caesar's,
         and to God what is God's'"
        │
        └─► ἀπόδοτε (apodote) — "Give back, render"
            │
            Not: "Pay for first time"
            IS: "Return what belongs"
            │
            TWO OBLIGATIONS:
            │
            ├─ TO CAESAR: "What is Caesar's"
            │   │
            │   └─► What bears Caesar's image?
            │       The COIN
            │       │
            │       → Pay tax with Caesar's coin
            │         Using his currency
            │         In his empire
            │         │

            │
            └─► TO GOD: "What is God's"
                │
                └─► What bears GOD'S image?
                    │
                    HUMANS (Gen 1:27)
                    │
                    "God created mankind in his image"
                    │
                    → Give YOURSELF to God
                      Not just money
                      │
                      Total allegiance
                      │
                      Coin to Caesar
                      Life to God

THE BRILLIANCE:
    │
    └─► Escapes both horns:
        │
        ├─ Affirms tax payment (satisfies Rome)
        └─► Affirms God's supremacy (satisfies Jews)
            │
            BUT:
            │
            └─► Reframes question entirely

                Not: Either/or

                    ├─ Earthly kingdom (Caesar)
                    └─► Heavenly kingdom (God)
                        │
                        → Both legitimate
                          In proper sphere
                          │

### 3. Marriage & Resurrection (vv. 23-33) — WRONG CATEGORIES

**Key Greek:**
- Σαδδουκαῖος (Saddoukaios) — "Sadducee"
- ἀνάστασις (anastasis) — "resurrection, rising up"
- πλανάω (planaō) — "lead astray, deceive"
- δύναμις (dynamis) — "power"

```
THE SADDUCEES (v. 23a)
    │
    └─► "That same day the Sadducees,
         who say there is NO RESURRECTION,
         came to him with a question"
        │
        └─► Who are Sadducees?
            │
            ├─ Religious party
            │   └─► Aristocratic, wealthy
            │       Temple establishment
            │       High priestly families
            │
            ├─ Theologically:
            │   │
            │   └─► Accept ONLY Torah (5 books)
            │       Reject: Prophets, Writings (as binding)
            │       │
            │       → Reject oral tradition
            │         (Unlike Pharisees)
            │
            └─► Key belief: NO resurrection
                │
                Acts 23:8: "Sadducees say there is no resurrection,
                            and neither angel nor spirit,
                            but Pharisees believe all these"
                │
                → Materialists
                  Death = end
                  │
                  No afterlife
                  No spiritual realm

WHY NO RESURRECTION?
    │
    └─► Torah never explicitly teaches it
        │
        (Developed in later books:
         Dan 12:2, Isa 26:19)
        │
        → If not in Torah, not binding
          │
          This is their test case
```

**The Setup (vv. 23b-28):**

```
CITING MOSES (v. 24)
    │
    └─► "'Teacher,' they said,
         'Moses told us that if a man dies without having children,
         his brother must marry the widow
         and raise up offspring for him'"
        │
        └─► Deut 25:5-6 (Levirate marriage)
            │
            "If brothers dwell together,
             and one dies without a son,
             the wife of the dead shall not marry outside...
             her husband's brother shall go in to her...
             first son she bears shall succeed
             to name of his dead brother"
            │
            → Purpose: Preserve family line
              Protect widow
              │
              Property stays in family

THE RIDICULOUS SCENARIO (vv. 25-28)
    │
    └─► "Now there were seven brothers among us.
         The first one married and died,
         and since he had no children,
         he left his wife to his brother.
         The same thing happened to the second and third brother,
         right on down to the seventh.
         Finally, the woman died.
         Now then, at the resurrection,
         whose wife will she be of the seven,
         since all of them were married to her?"
        │
        └─► Absurd multiplication:
            │
            ├─ SEVEN brothers
            │   └─► Not 2 or 3
            │       SEVEN
            │       │
            │       → Maximally ridiculous
            │
            ├─ ALL marry same woman
            │   └─► Each dies
            │       Each childless
            │       │
            │       Woman survives all 7
            │
            └─► Question: "Whose wife at resurrection?"
                │
                → Designed to show absurdity
                  │
                  Resurrection = impossible complications
                  │
                  Better: No resurrection
                  Problem solved!

THEIR ASSUMPTION:
    │
    └─► Resurrection = continuation of earthly life
        │
        Same bodies
        Same relationships
        Same structures
        │
        → If resurrection, then:
          Polyandry in heaven?
          (One woman, multiple husbands)
          │
          Ridiculous!
          │
          Therefore: No resurrection
          │
          → Category error:
            Assuming heaven = earth
```

**Jesus' Rebuke (vv. 29-30):**

```
THE DIAGNOSIS (v. 29)
    │
    └─► "Jesus replied,
         'You are in ERROR
         because you do not know the SCRIPTURES
         or the POWER of God'"
        │
        └─► πλανᾶσθε (planasthe)
            │
            "You are deceived, led astray"
            │
            → Not: honest mistake
              IS: Fundamental error
              │
              TWO IGNORANCES:
              │
              ├─ "Do not know SCRIPTURES"
              │   │
              │   └─► μὴ εἰδότες τὰς γραφὰς
              │       │
              │       They claim: Torah experts
              │       Reality: Miss the point
              │       │
              │       → Read letter, miss spirit
              │         │
              │         Exod 3:6: "I am God of Abraham..."
              │         (Jesus will cite this, v. 32)
              │         │
              │         Present tense = living relationship
              │         They missed it
              │
              └─► "Do not know POWER of God"
                  │
                  μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ θεοῦ
                  │
                  → God's power to:
                    │
                    ├─ Raise dead
                    ├─ Transform bodies
                    └─► Create new mode of existence
                        │
                        They limit God
                        To earthly categories
                        │
                        "Can't imagine it, therefore impossible"
                        │
                        → Failure of imagination
                          = Failure of faith

THE CORRECTION (v. 30)
    │
    └─► "At the resurrection
         people will neither marry nor be given in marriage;
         they will be like the ANGELS in heaven"
        │
        └─► Resurrection reality:
            │
            ├─ "Neither marry nor given in marriage"
            │   │
            │   └─► No new marriages

            │       NOT: Marriages annulled
            │       IS: Marriage institution = earthly

            │           │
            │           ├─- No procreation needed
            │           │   (Death defeated)
            │           │
            │           └─► Perfect communion with God + saints

                  In what way?
                  │
                  └─► Angels don't marry
                      Angels don't die
                      Angels live in God's presence
                      │
                      → Resurrection = higher mode
                        Not: earthly life 2.0
                        IS: Transformed existence

```

**Scriptural Proof (vv. 31-32):**

```
THE ARGUMENT (vv. 31-32)
    │
    └─► "But about the RESURRECTION of the dead—
         have you not read what God said to you,
         'I AM the God of Abraham,
         the God of Isaac,
         and the God of Jacob'?
         He is not the God of the DEAD
         but of the LIVING"
        │
        └─► "Have you not read?" (οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε)
            │
            → Ironic
              They're the readers
              Experts in Torah
              │
              Yet: Haven't READ properly

CITATION: EXODUS 3:6
    │
    └─► Burning bush
        God reveals name to Moses
        │
        "I AM the God of Abraham,
         the God of Isaac,
         and the God of Jacob"
        │
        KEY: Present tense
        │
        "I AM" (ἐγώ εἰμι)
        │
        NOT: "I WAS their God"
        IS: "I AM their God"
        │
        → At time of Moses:
          │
          Abraham dead 400+ years
          Isaac dead 300+ years
          Jacob dead 200+ years
          │
          Yet God says: "I AM their God"
          │
          Present, ongoing relationship

THE LOGIC:
    │
    └─► "He is not God of DEAD but of LIVING"
        │
        οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ θεὸς νεκρῶν ἀλλὰ ζώντων
        │
        → If God = their God (present)
          Then: They must be alive (somehow)
          │
          Not: Ceased to exist
          IS: Living in God's presence
          │
          Awaiting resurrection
          │
          Luke 20:38: "He is not God of the dead,
                       but of the living,
                       for to him ALL are alive"
          │
          → In God's perspective: All alive
            │
            Death = temporary
            Resurrection = certain
            │
            Based on: God's covenant faithfulness

IMPLICIT ARGUMENT:
    │
    └─► Sadducees accept: Torah only
        │
        Jesus uses: Torah only (Exodus)
        │
        Beats them on own ground
        │
        → Can't dismiss as "later tradition"
          It's in MOSES
          │
          They missed it
```

**The Result (v. 33):**

```
ASTONISHMENT (v. 33)
    │
    └─► "When the crowds heard this,
         they were ASTONISHED at his teaching"
        │
        └─► ἐξεπλήσσοντο (exeplēssonto)
            │
            "Were astounded, amazed"
            │
            Imperfect tense: Ongoing amazement
            │
            → Not just clever answer
              Profound teaching
              │
              ├─ Resurrection affirmed
              ├─ From Torah itself
              └─► Transformed existence explained
                  │
                  Crowds recognize: Wisdom
                  │
                  Sadducees: Silenced

"LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR"
    │
    └─► ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου
        │
        Who is "neighbor" (πλησίον)?

              Can't refute logic

                By own Messiah expectations

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Jesus warns that many will reject God's gracious invitation and face judgment, navigates three trap questions by revealing dual citizenship under God and Caesar, transformed resurrection existence, and the supremacy of love, then silences all opponents by exposing the Messiah as both David's human son and divine Lord.**

## Personal Notes

### The Wedding Feast Architecture

**Three Responses to Invitation:**
1. **Indifference** (vv. 3-5) — Too busy
2. **Violence** (v. 6) — Kill messengers
3. **Presumption** (vv. 11-13) — Come without garment

All three = rejection
All three = judgment

**The Garment Paradox:**
- Grace gets you in (invitation to anyone)
- Righteousness keeps you in (must wear garment)
- Can't earn it, but must have it
- Freely given, but must be received

**Echoes:**
- Rev 3:18: "White clothes to wear, so you can cover shameful nakedness"
- Rev 7:14: "Washed robes... made white in blood of Lamb"
- 2 Cor 5:21: "God made him... to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God"

### The Three Traps Pattern

```
TRAP SEQUENCE:
    │
    ├─ Political (vv. 15-22)
    │   └─► Pharisees + Herodians
    │       Natural enemies unite
    │       │
    │       Try to force: Rome vs God
    │       Jesus shows: Both/and
    │
    ├─ Theological (vv. 23-33)
    │   └─► Sadducees (deny resurrection)
    │       Try to show: Resurrection absurd
    │       Jesus shows: Your categories wrong
    │
    └─► Legal (vv. 34-40)
        └─► Pharisees (experts in Torah)
            Try to catch: In legal technicality
            Jesus shows: Perfect summary
```

Each trap:
1. Carefully planned
2. Designed to destroy
3. Completely fails
4. Results in amazement

### Caesar's Image vs God's Image

The brilliance of v. 21:
- Coin bears Caesar's image → Give to Caesar
- Humans bear God's image (Gen 1:27) → Give to God

**What this means:**
- Civil obligations are real (pay taxes, obey laws)
- But: You owe God YOURSELF
- Not: 10% (tithe)
- IS: 100% (life)

**When they conflict:**
- Acts 4:19: "Judge for yourselves whether right in God's sight to listen to you rather than God"
- Acts 5:29: "We must obey God rather than human beings"

### The Resurrection Body

Jesus corrects fundamental misunderstanding:
- Sadducees think: Resurrection = resuscitation
- Jesus teaches: Resurrection = transformation

**Key differences:**
- Not: Same earthly existence extended
- IS: New mode of being

**Like angels in what way?**
1. Don't marry (procreation unnecessary)
2. Don't die (purpose of marriage gone)
3. Live in God's presence (perfect fellowship)

**Not like angels:**
- We remain human (not become angels)
- We have bodies (angels are spirits)
- We are redeemed creation (angels are created order)

### The Great Commandment Structure

```
HIERARCHY:
    │
    ├─ FIRST: Love God
    │   │
    │   └─► Vertical relationship
    │       Foundation of everything
    │       │
    │       Deut 6:5
    │
    └─► SECOND: Love neighbor
        │
        └─► Horizontal relationship
            Flows from first
            │
            Lev 19:18
            │
            │
            ALL LAW hangs on these two
```

**Not three separate commands:**
1. Love God
2. Love self
3. Love neighbor

**But two commands:**
1. Love God (absolutely)
2. Love neighbor as self (comparatively)

Assumes proper self-love (care, concern)
Commands same for neighbor

### The Messiah Question

Psalm 110:1 = Most important OT text for early church

**Why?**
- Proves: Messiah is divine
- Shows: Messiah exalted to God's right hand
- Demonstrates: Enemies will be defeated

**The logic:**
1. Messiah = David's son (human lineage)
2. David calls him "Lord" (superior status)
3. Only God is superior to David
4. Therefore: Messiah is God

**Application:**
- Jesus = David's descendant (Matt 1:1)
- Jesus = David's Lord (Psalm 110:1)
- Therefore: Jesus = God incarnate

This is why question silences everyone
This is the central claim
This is what you must answer:

**Who do YOU say Jesus is?**

Human teacher? No.
Great prophet? Insufficient.
David's son? Yes... but not just.

David's son AND David's Lord
Fully human AND fully divine

**Phil 2:6-11:**
"Being in very nature God...
made himself nothing...
taking very nature of servant...
being made in human likeness...
God exalted him to highest place...
every knee should bow...
every tongue acknowledge:
Jesus Christ is Lord"

This is the answer
This is the truth
This is what demands response

Not academic
Not theoretical

Personal:
What will YOU do with Jesus?
