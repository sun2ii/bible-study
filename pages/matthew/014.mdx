## The Courage Question

```
JOHN'S DEATH vs HEROD'S COMPROMISE
    │
    ├─ JOHN:
    │   ├─ Spoke truth to power
    │   ├─ "Not lawful for you to have her"
    │   └─► Consequence: Beheaded
    │       │
    │       └─► Courage = costly
    │           But integrity intact
    │
    └─► HEROD:
        ├─ Feared people (v. 5)
        ├─ Feared losing face (v. 9)
        └─► Compromise: Murdered prophet
            │
            └─► Image preserved
                Conscience destroyed
                │
                └─► Which is worse?
                    │
                    ├─ Dying with integrity (John)
                    └─► Living with guilt (Herod)
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. John's Martyrdom (vv. 1-12) — COURAGE vs COMPROMISE

```
HEROD'S SUPERSTITION (vv. 1-2)
    │
    ├─ "At that time Herod the TETRARCH
    │    heard the REPORTS about Jesus"
    │   │
    │   └─► Herod Antipas (not Herod the Great)
    │       │
    │       ├─ Son of Herod the Great
    │       ├─ Ruled Galilee & Perea (4 BC - AD 39)
    │       └─► "Tetrarch" = ruler of 1/4 region
    │           │
    │           └─► Lesser title than "king"
    │               (v. 9 calls him "king" - courtesy title)
    │
    └─► His conclusion (v. 2):
        │
        └─► "This is JOHN THE BAPTIST;
             he has RISEN FROM THE DEAD!
             That is why miraculous powers are at work in him"
            │
            └─► Three errors:
                │
                ├─ Jesus IS John resurrected
                │   └─► Guilt produces superstition
                │       Can't escape John's ghost
                │
                ├─ Resurrection explains miracles
                │   └─► Partial truth
                │       Jesus WILL rise (but not yet)
                │       │
                │       └─► Herod's guilt sees resurrection
                │           Before it happens
                │
                └─► Can't distinguish Jesus from John
                    │
                    └─► Guilt clouds perception
                        Haunted by the murdered
```

**Herod's Guilt Psychology:**

```
GUILTY CONSCIENCE
    │
    └─► Herod killed John
        │
        └─► Now hears about Jesus' miracles
            │
            ├─ Can't explain supernatural power
            └─► Jumps to: "John is back"
                │
                └─► Superstition born from guilt
                    │
                    └─► Can't escape the murdered prophet
                        His voice still haunts
                        │
                        └─► Prov 28:1: "The wicked flee
                                         though no one pursues"
```

```
FLASHBACK: THE ARREST (vv. 3-5)
    │
    ├─ The crime (v. 3):
    │   │
    │   └─► "Herod had ARRESTED John
    │        and BOUND him and put him in PRISON
    │        because of HERODIAS, his brother Philip's wife"
    │       │
    │       └─► The scandal:
    │           │
    │           ├─ Herodias = wife of Philip (Herod's half-brother)
    │           ├─ Herod seduced/stole his brother's wife
    │           └─► Both divorced spouses to marry
    │               │
    │               └─► Multiple violations:
    │                   │
    │                   ├─ Adultery
    │                   ├─ Incest (sister-in-law)
    │                   └─► Divorce without grounds
    │                       │
    │                       └─► Public scandal
    │                           Royal adultery
    │
    ├─ John's rebuke (v. 4):
    │   │
    │   └─► "For John had been saying to him:
    │        'It is NOT LAWFUL for you to have her'"
    │       │
    │       └─► οὐκ ἔξεστιν (ouk exestin) — "not lawful"
    │           │
    │           └─► John's courage:
    │               │
    │               ├─ Confronted KING directly
    │               ├─ Named the sin publicly
    │               └─► Didn't soften message
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Leviticus 18:16: "Do not have
    │                                          sexual relations with
    │                                          your brother's wife"
    │                       │
    │                       └─► John called out:
    │                           │
    │                           ├─ Powerful leader
    │                           ├─ On sexual sin
    │                           └─► Knowing the cost
    │
    ├─ Herod's dilemma (v. 5):
    │   │
    │   └─► "Herod WANTED TO KILL John,
    │        but he was AFRAID OF THE PEOPLE,
    │        because they considered John a prophet"
    │       │
    │       └─► Two fears compete:
    │           │
    │           ├─ HERODIAS' anger
    │           │   └─► She wanted John dead
    │           │       Pressured Herod constantly
    │           │
    │           └─► PEOPLE'S reaction
    │               │
    │               └─► They loved John as prophet
    │                   Would riot if killed
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Herod fears MAN
    │                       Not God
    │                       │
    │                       └─► Imprisoned John (compromise)
    │                           Silenced but not killed
    │                           Trying to please both sides
    │
    └─► Mark 6:20 adds:
        │
        └─► "Herod feared John and protected him,
             knowing him to be a righteous and holy man.
             When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled;
             yet he liked to listen to him"
            │
            └─► Herod was DRAWN to John
                Fascinated by his righteousness
                │
                └─► But wouldn't OBEY
                    Listened but didn't submit
                    │
                    └─► Heard truth, rejected it
                        Puzzle → Prison → Murder
```

**The Trap of Compromise:**

```
HEROD'S FATAL MISTAKE
    │
    └─► Compromise = slow death
        │
        ├─ Step 1: Adultery with Herodias
        ├─ Step 2: Arrest John (silence critic)
        ├─ Step 3: Keep John alive (fear people)
        └─► Step 4: Eventually murder (trap closes)
            │
            └─► Trying to please everyone
                Ends up destroying prophet
                │
                └─► Prov 29:25: "Fear of man = snare"
```

```
THE BANQUET TRAP (vv. 6-11)
    │
    ├─ The party (v. 6):
    │   │
    │   └─► "On Herod's BIRTHDAY
    │        the daughter of Herodias DANCED for the guests
    │        and PLEASED Herod so much"
    │       │
    │       └─► Setting:
    │           │
    │           ├─ Royal birthday celebration
    │           ├─ Daughter (Salome - named by Josephus)
    │           │   └─► Herodias' daughter from first marriage
    │           │       Herod's step-daughter AND niece
    │           │
    │           └─► Dance "pleased Herod"
    │               │
    │               └─► Likely sensual/seductive
    │                   Inappropriate for royal court
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Drunken king, manipulated by dance
    │
    ├─ The oath (v. 7):
    │   │
    │   └─► "He PROMISED WITH AN OATH
    │        to give her WHATEVER SHE ASKED"
    │       │
    │       └─► μεθ' ὅρκου (meth' horkou) — "with oath"
    │           │
    │           └─► Rash promise:
    │               │
    │               ├─ PUBLIC oath (before guests)
    │               ├─ UNLIMITED scope ("whatever")
    │               └─► BINDING commitment
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Herod trapped himself
    │                       Pride + alcohol + lust = disaster
    │
    ├─ The request (v. 8):
    │   │
    │   └─► "PROMPTED BY HER MOTHER, she said,
    │        'Give me here on a PLATTER
    │         the HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST'"
    │       │
    │       └─► Herodias' revenge:
    │           │
    │           ├─ She coached her daughter
    │           │   └─► This was her plan all along
    │           │       Set the trap via dance
    │           │
    │           ├─ Specific demand: "HEAD on PLATTER"
    │           │   └─► Not just death
    │           │       GRUESOME, HUMILIATING death
    │           │       │
    │           │       └─► Served like food at banquet
    │           │           Ultimate mockery
    │           │
    │           └─► "Here" (ὧδε) — immediate
    │               │
    │               └─► Not "eventually"
    │                   Right NOW, at party
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Herodias' hatred was DEEP
    │                       Couldn't wait for execution
    │
    ├─ The distress (v. 9):
    │   │
    │   └─► "The king was DISTRESSED,
    │        but because of his OATHS
    │        and his DINNER GUESTS,
    │        he ordered that her request be granted"
    │       │
    │       └─► ἐλυπήθη (elypēthē) — "grieved, distressed"
    │           │
    │           └─► Herod didn't WANT to kill John
    │               │
    │               └─► But...
    │                   │
    │                   ├─ OATHS (plural - repeated vows)
    │                   │   └─► Public commitment made
    │                   │       Can't back down
    │                   │
    │                   └─► DINNER GUESTS watching
    │                       │
    │                       └─► Fear of SHAME > fear of SIN
    │                           │
    │                           └─► Image management kills prophet
    │                               Pride demands John's head
    │
    ├─ The execution (vv. 10-11):
    │   │
    │   ├─ "He had John BEHEADED in the prison" (v. 10)
    │   │   └─► Quick execution
    │   │       No trial, no defense
    │   │       Murder at banquet's command
    │   │
    │   └─► "His HEAD was brought in on a PLATTER
    │        and given to the girl,
    │        who carried it to her mother" (v. 11)
    │       │
    │       └─► Ghastly scene:
    │           │
    │           ├─ John's head = party centerpiece
    │           ├─ Given to dancing girl
    │           └─► Delivered to Herodias
    │               │
    │               └─► Her revenge complete
    │                   Prophet silenced forever
    │                   │
    │                   └─► She thought.
    │
    └─► The burial (v. 12):
        │
        └─► "John's disciples came
             and took his BODY and BURIED it.
             Then they went and TOLD JESUS"
            │
            └─► Faithful to the end:
                │
                ├─ Claimed his body
                ├─ Gave proper burial
                └─► Reported to Jesus
                    │
                    └─► Jesus = John's successor
                        Torch passed
                        │
                        └─► Jesus now faces same opposition
                            What happened to herald
                            Awaits the King
```

**The Martyrdom Pattern:**

| Element | John's Death | Jesus' Death (foreshadowed) |
|---------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Accusation | "Not lawful" | "Blasphemy" |
| Ruler | Herod (weak) | Pilate (weak) |
| Motivation | Fear of shame | Fear of riot |
| Method | Beheading | Crucifixion |
| Burial | Disciples | Disciples (Joseph of Arimathea) |
| Report | Told Jesus | Told... (resurrection) |

```
JOHN'S LEGACY
    │
    └─► Died for speaking truth
        │
        ├─ Didn't compromise
        ├─ Didn't soften message
        └─► Paid ultimate price
            │
            └─► Jesus later says (11:11):
                "Among those born of women
                 none greater than John"
                │
                └─► Greatness measured by:
                    │
                    ├─ Not power preserved
                    └─► Truth proclaimed
                        │
                        └─► John: Faithful unto death
                            Rev 2:10: "Be faithful, even to death,
                                       and I will give you the crown of life"
```

**Diagnostic:** *Am I more like John (courageous truth) or Herod (fear of man)? Do I compromise to preserve image?*

**One-line:** John dies for truth while Herod murders to save face—courage costs, compromise kills, but integrity outlasts life.

JESUS' WITHDRAWAL (v. 13a)
    │
    └─► "When Jesus HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED,
         he WITHDREW by boat privately to a SOLITARY PLACE"
        │
        └─► Heard what? John's death (v. 12)
            │
            └─► Jesus' response to grief:
                │
                ├─ WITHDREW (ἀνεχώρησεν)
                │   └─► Retreated, pulled back
                │       Not fleeing fear
                │       Processing grief
                │
                ├─ BY BOAT
                │   └─► Water travel (Sea of Galilee)
                │       Harder to follow
                │
                ├─ PRIVATELY
                │   └─► κατ' ἰδίαν (kat' idian) — "by himself"
                │       Seeking solitude
                │
                └─► To SOLITARY place (ἔρημον τόπον)
                    └─► "Desert place, wilderness"
                        │
                        └─► Why withdraw?
                            │
                            ├─ GRIEF: John was cousin, forerunner
                            │   └─► Jesus feels loss deeply
                            │       Fully human emotions
                            │
                            ├─ DANGER: Herod now aware of Jesus
                            │   └─► v. 1-2: Herod fears Jesus is John
                            │       Threat level increasing
                            │
                            └─► PRAYER: Needs Father's presence

                                └─► Luke 5:16: "Jesus often withdrew
                                                 to lonely places and prayed"
```

**Jesus' Grief:**

```
FULLY HUMAN
    │
    └─► Jesus didn't skip grief
        │
        ├─ He FELT loss (John's death)
        ├─ He WITHDREW (needed space)
        └─► He sought SOLITUDE with Father
            │
            └─► Grief ≠ lack of faith
                Grief = part of love
                │
                └─► John 11:35: "Jesus wept"
                    Rom 12:15: "Mourn with those who mourn"
```

```
THE CROWD FOLLOWS (vv. 13b-14)
    │
    ├─ "Hearing of this, the CROWDS FOLLOWED him
    │    on FOOT from the towns" (v. 13b)
    │   │
    │   └─► Jesus sought solitude
    │       Crowds pursued
    │       │
    │       └─► They walked around lake
    │           Jesus sailed
    │           But they BEAT Him there
    │           │
    │           └─► No rest for Jesus
    │               Ministry interrupts grief
    │
    └─► Jesus' response (v. 14):
        │
        └─► "When Jesus landed and saw a LARGE CROWD,
             he had COMPASSION on them
             and HEALED their sick"
            │
            └─► σπλαγχνίζομαι (splanchnizomai)
                "To be moved in the gut, deeply compassionate"
                │
                └─► Jesus' compassion:
                    │
                    ├─ Despite His GRIEF
                    │   └─► Still mourning John
                    │       But sees their need
                    │
                    ├─ Despite His PLAN
                    │   └─► Sought solitude
                    │       But interrupted
                    │       │
                    │       └─► Doesn't send them away
                    │           Receives them
                    │
                    └─► Result: HEALED their sick
                        │
                        └─► Not just teaching
                            Active compassion
                            Touching, healing, serving
                            │
                            └─► His grief doesn't make Him
                                unavailable to others' pain
```

**The Compassion Principle:**

```
JESUS' HEART
    │
    └─► Compassion = gut-level feeling
        │
        └─► Not: "That's too bad"
            IS: "I FEEL your pain"
            │
            └─► This word (splanchnizomai) appears when:
                │
                ├─ Jesus sees crowds (9:36)
                ├─ Jesus sees leper (Mk 1:41)
                ├─ Jesus sees widow (Lk 7:13)
                └─► Jesus sees hungry crowds (here)
                    │
                    └─► Compassion → ACTION
                        Feeling → Healing
```

```
THE DISCIPLES' SOLUTION (v. 15)
    │
    └─► "As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said,
         'This is a REMOTE PLACE, and it's already getting LATE.
          SEND THE CROWDS AWAY,
          so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food'"
        │
        └─► Their logic:
            │
            ├─ LOCATION: Remote (ἔρημος) — no food here
            ├─ TIME: Late — shops closing soon
            └─► SOLUTION: Send them away
                │
                └─► Pragmatic thinking:
                    │
                    ├─ We can't feed them
                    ├─ They need to fend for themselves
                    └─► Dismiss the problem
                        │
                        └─► Reasonable, but...
                            Missing opportunity for miracle
```

```
JESUS' COUNTER-COMMAND (v. 16)
    │
    └─► "Jesus replied,
         'They do NOT NEED to go away.
          YOU give them something to eat'"
        │
        └─► Two challenges:
            │
            ├─ "NOT NEED to go away"
            │   └─► Problem doesn't require departure
            │       Solution is HERE
            │
            └─► "YOU give them"
                │
                └─► ὑμεῖς (hymeis) — "YOU yourselves"
                    Emphatic pronoun
                    │
                    └─► Jesus assigns task to disciples
                        They must provide
                        │
                        └─► Testing their faith
                            Will they look to Him?
```

```
THE INADEQUATE RESOURCES (v. 17)
    │
    └─► "'We have here only FIVE LOAVES of bread
         and TWO FISH,' they answered"
        │
        └─► Their inventory:
            │
            ├─ 5 loaves (ἄρτοι) — barley bread (Jn 6:9)
            │   └─► Poor man's bread
            │       Coarse, cheap
            │
            └─► 2 fish (ἰχθύες) — small dried fish
                │
                └─► "Only" (μόνον) — emphatic
                    │
                    └─► This is NOTHING
                        For crowd this size
                        │
                        └─► Later: 5,000 men (v. 21)
                            + women + children
                            = ~10,000-15,000 people
                            │
                            └─► 5 loaves + 2 fish = ridiculous
                                Disciples see IMPOSSIBILITY
```

**The Inadequacy Setup:**

```
GOD'S PATTERN
    │
    └─► God specializes in inadequate resources
        │
        ├─ Moses: "Who am I?" → Led exodus
        ├─ Gideon: 300 men vs army → Victory
        ├─ David: Sling vs giant → Giant falls
        ├─ Widow: Jar of oil → Fills all vessels
        └─► Here: 5 + 2 → 5,000 fed
            │
            └─► 2 Cor 12:9: "My power is made perfect
                              in weakness"
```

```
JESUS' PROCESS (vv. 18-19)
    │
    ├─ Command (v. 18):
    │   │
    │   └─► "'BRING THEM HERE TO ME,' he said"
    │       │
    │       └─► Bring inadequate resources TO JESUS
    │           │
    │           └─► Not: "Get more food"
    │               IS: "Give me what you have"
    │               │
    │               └─► Jesus works with what's given
    │                   However small
    │
    ├─ Organization (v. 19a):
    │   │
    │   └─► "He directed the people to SIT DOWN on the grass"
    │       │
    │       └─► Mark 6:40 adds: "In groups of 50s and 100s"
    │           │
    │           └─► Order before miracle
    │               Organization for distribution
    │               │
    │               └─► Preparing for abundance
    │
    └─► The blessing (v. 19b):
        │
        └─► "Taking the five loaves and the two fish
             and LOOKING UP TO HEAVEN,
             he gave THANKS and BROKE the loaves"
            │
            └─► Four actions:
                │
                ├─ TAKING (λαβών) — received what was given
                │
                ├─ LOOKING UP — eyes to heaven
                │   └─► Acknowledging source
                │       Not from self, from Father
                │
                ├─ GAVE THANKS (εὐλόγησεν) — "blessed"
                │   └─► εὐλογέω (eulogeō) — "spoke well of"
                │       │
                │       └─► Not blessing food to make it holy
                │           Blessing GOD for provision
                │           │
                │           └─► Gratitude BEFORE multiplication
                │               Thanking for 5 loaves
                │               As if it's already enough
                │
                └─► BROKE (ἔκλασεν) — broke the loaves
                    │
                    └─► κλάω (klaō) — "to break, fracture"
                        │
                        └─► Bread must be BROKEN to multiply
                            │
                            └─► Foreshadows Last Supper:
                                Same four actions (26:26)
                                │
                                └─► Took, blessed, broke, gave
                                    Body broken for many
```

**The Multiplication Sequence:**

```
WHEN DID MULTIPLICATION HAPPEN?
    │
    └─► Text doesn't say explicitly
        │
        └─► Possibilities:
            │
            ├─ In Jesus' hands (as He broke)
            ├─ In disciples' hands (as they distributed)
            └─► Continuous creation throughout
                │
                └─► The MYSTERY of provision
                    │
                    └─► They gave what they had
                        Jesus multiplied as needed
                        │
                        └─► Ex nihilo creation
                            From nothing, abundance
```

```
THE DISTRIBUTION & RESULT (vv. 19c-21)
    │
    ├─ Distribution chain (v. 19c):
    │   │
    │   └─► "Then he gave them to the DISCIPLES,
    │        and the disciples gave them to the PEOPLE"
    │       │
    │       └─► Jesus → Disciples → People
    │           │
    │           └─► Disciples as mediators
    │               │
    │               ├─ They bring inadequate resources
    │               ├─ Jesus multiplies
    │               └─► They distribute abundance
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Pattern for ministry:
    │                       Bring what you have to Jesus
    │                       Let Him multiply
    │                       Distribute His provision
    │
    ├─ Complete satisfaction (v. 20a):
    │   │
    │   └─► "They ALL ate and were SATISFIED"
    │       │
    │       └─► ἐχορτάσθησαν (echortasthēsan) — "filled, satiated"
    │           │
    │           └─► Not just "had a snack"
    │               FULLY satisfied
    │               │
    │               └─► All = everyone (10,000+ people)
    │                   No one went hungry
    │                   Complete provision
    │
    ├─ Abundant leftovers (v. 20b):
    │   │
    │   └─► "The disciples picked up TWELVE BASKETFULS
    │        of broken pieces that were LEFT OVER"
    │       │
    │       └─► κόφινος (kophinos) — "basket, wicker basket"
    │           │
    │           └─► Jewish carrying basket
    │               │
    │               └─► TWELVE baskets:
    │                   │
    │                   ├─ One per disciple
    │                   │   └─► Each carries leftovers
    │                   │       More than they started with
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Symbolic number (12 tribes)
    │                       │
    │                       └─► Abundance for Israel
    │                           God provides MORE than enough
    │
    └─► The count (v. 21):
        │
        └─► "The number of those who ate was

                                        Making something from (almost) nothing
```

**The Feeding Miracle:**

| Started With | Result | Leftover | Lesson |
|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| 5 loaves + 2 fish | 10,000+ fed | 12 baskets | Jesus creates abundance from inadequacy |
| Disciples: "Only" | Crowd: "Satisfied" | More than began | God's math: 5+2 = 5,000+ |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I bring my inadequacy to Jesus or hide it in shame? Do I believe He creates from nothing?*

**One-line:** Jesus multiplies five loaves and two fish to feed 10,000+, creating abundance from inadequacy with leftovers proving divine provision.

### 3. Walking on Water (vv. 22-33) — FAITH vs FEAR

```
THE DISMISSAL (vv. 22-23a)
    │
    ├─ Compelled departure (v. 22):
    │   │
    │   └─► "IMMEDIATELY Jesus MADE the disciples
    │        get into the boat
    │        and go on ahead of him to the other side,
    │        while he dismissed the crowd"
    │       │
    │       └─► ἠνάγκασεν (ēnankgasen) — "compelled, forced"
    │           │
    │           └─► Strong word: Jesus INSISTED
    │               Disciples must leave NOW
    │               │
    │               └─► Why the urgency?
    │                   │
    │                   └─► John 6:15: "Perceiving they were about to

    │                                    He withdrew again to the mountain"
    │                       │
    │                       └─► After feeding miracle:
    │                           Crowd wants political Messiah
    │                           Force Him to be earthly king
    │                           │
    │                           └─► Jesus must:
    │                               ├─ Remove disciples (protect from mob)
    │                               └─► Disperse crowd (prevent uprising)

    └─► The mountain (v. 23):
        │
        └─► "After he had dismissed them,
             he went up on a MOUNTAINSIDE
             BY HIMSELF to PRAY.
             Later that night, he was there ALONE"
            │
            └─► Jesus' pattern:
                │
                ├─ Dismissed crowd (thousands sent home)
                ├─ Dismissed disciples (sent ahead)
                └─► ALONE with Father
                    │
                    └─► After massive miracle
                        Jesus seeks SOLITUDE
                        │
                        ├─ Not basking in success
                        ├─ Not accepting praise
                        └─► Praying through the night
                            │
                            └─► Mark 1:35: "Very early in morning,
                                             while still dark,
                                             Jesus got up, left house,
                                             went off to solitary place,
                                             where he prayed"
```

**Jesus' Prayer Life:**

```
PATTERN OF SOLITUDE
    │
    └─► After MAJOR EVENTS, Jesus withdraws:
        │
        ├─ After John's death → solitude (v. 13)
        ├─ After feeding 5,000 → mountain prayer (v. 23)
        ├─ After healing crowds → mountain prayer (Lk 6:12)
        └─► Before crucifixion → Gethsemane (26:36)
            │
            └─► If Jesus (Son of God) needed prayer
                How much more do we?
```

```
THE STORM (v. 24)
    │
    └─► "And the boat was already
         a CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE from land,
         BUFFETED BY THE WAVES
         because the WIND WAS AGAINST IT"
        │
        └─► Three difficulties:
            │
            ├─ FAR from land
            │   └─► σταδίους πολλοὺς (stadious pollous)
            │       "Many stadia" (25-30 stadia = 3-4 miles)
            │       Middle of lake
            │       │
            │       └─► Too far to turn back

            │       "Tormented, harassed, tortured"
            │       │
            │       └─► Not gentle rocking
            │           VIOLENT battering
            │
            └─► WIND against them
                │

                    │
                    └─► Rowing into headwind
                        Making no progress
                        Exhausting themselves
                        │
                        └─► They're obeying Jesus (v. 22)
                            Yet stuck in storm
                            │
                            └─► Obedience ≠ smooth sailing
                                Jesus SENT them into storm
```

**Storms and Obedience:**

```
THE STORM WASN'T DISOBEDIENCE
    │
    ├─ They didn't wander off course
    ├─ They were WHERE Jesus sent them
    └─► Yet: Storm raged
        │
        └─► Sometimes Jesus leads INTO storms
            Not away from them
            │
            └─► Testing faith
                Building dependence
                Preparing for miracle
```

```

                        9+ hours rowing
                        Jesus waited
                        │
                        └─► Why didn't He come earlier?

         they were TERRIFIED.
         'It's a GHOST,' they said,

        │
        └─► ἐταράχθησαν (etarachthēsan) — "troubled, terrified"
            │
            └─► Their logic:
                │
                └─► Can't be human (humans don't walk on water)
                    Must be ghost (φάντασμα / phantasma)
                    │
                    └─► They don't recognize Jesus

                        │
                        └─► Mixed motives:

         WALKED ON THE WATER
         and came TOWARD JESUS"
        │
        └─► Peter actually DOES IT:
            │
            ├─ Gets out of boat (leaves safety)
            ├─ Walks on water (impossible act)
            └─► Moves toward Jesus
                │

                    │
                    └─► This is FAITH:

```
PETER'S TRAJECTORY
    │
    ├─ In boat: SAFE but stagnant
    │
    ├─ Request: "Command me to come" (faith + doubt)
    │
    ├─ Invitation: "Come" (Jesus enables)
    │
    ├─ Walking: EYES ON JESUS → success
    │
    ├─ Shift: EYES ON WIND → fear
    │
    ├─ Sinking: Fear → failure
    │
    └─► Rescue: "Lord, save!" → saved
        │
        └─► Even failing faith
            Cries to right Person

    └─► "IMMEDIATELY Jesus reached out his hand
         and CAUGHT him.

            │       │
            │       └─► Jesus doesn't let him drown
            │           Even in failure
            │
            ├─ Physical rescue: "Reached out and caught"
            │   └─► Simple, gentle action
            │       Hand extended
            │       Peter grabbed
            │
            └─► Rebuke: "Little faith... why doubt?"

                            ├─ Leave boat

                                            One eye on Jesus
                                            One eye on storm
                                            │
                                            └─► James 1:6-8: "He who doubts
                                                              is like wave of sea,

**Little Faith vs No Faith:**

| No Faith | Little Faith (Peter) | Great Faith |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Stays in boat | Gets out of boat | Walks without wavering |
| Doesn't try | Tries but fails | Succeeds fully |
| Never risks | Risks then retreats | Risks and trusts |
| **Jesus' response:** — | **"Why doubt?"** | **"Your faith is great"** |

THE WORSHIP (v. 33)
    │
    └─► "Then those who were in the boat
         WORSHIPED him, saying,
         'TRULY YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD'"
        │
        └─► προσεκύνησαν (prosekunēsan) — "worshiped, bowed down"
            │
            └─► This is WORSHIP

                                    ├─ Calmed storm instantly
                                    └─► Only GOD does these things

                                        └─► Peter's failure led to

                                            └─► His sinking revealed
                                                Jesus' deity
```

**The Worship Progression:**

```
MATTHEW'S REVEALS JESUS
    │
    ├─ 8:27: "What kind of man is this?"
    │   └─► After calming storm
    │       Question, not confession
    │
    └─► 14:33: "Truly you are the Son of God"
        │
        └─► After walking on water
            Clear confession
            │
            └─► Revelation increases
                Worship deepens
```

**Diagnostic:** *When storms rage, do I focus on Jesus or circumstances? Do I have faith to leave the boat?*

**One-line:** Jesus walks on water, Peter walks then sinks when fear shifts focus from Christ to storm—immediate rescue leads to worship.

         just TOUCH THE EDGE OF HIS CLOAK"
        │
        └─► Their request:
            │
            └─► Not: "Lay hands on them"
                Not: "Speak a word"

                                            Just believing contact = enough
```

**The Touch Theology:**

```
WHY TOUCH THE GARMENT?
    │
    └─► Precedent: Woman with bleeding (9:20-22)
        │
        └─► She touched His cloak
            Was healed
            │
            └─► Word spread:
                "Touching Jesus = healing"
                │
                └─► Even GARMENT carries power
                    │
                    └─► Not magic
                        But faith meeting presence
                        │
                        └─► Acts 19:11-12: "God did extraordinary
                                             miracles through Paul,
                                             so that even handkerchiefs...
                                             were taken to the sick"
```

```
THE RESULT (v. 36b)
    │
    └─► "And ALL WHO TOUCHED IT
         were HEALED"
        │
        └─► 100% success rate:
            │
            ├─ ALL who touched
            │   └─► πάντες (pantes) — "all, everyone"
            │       No exceptions
            │       No failures
            │
            └─► Were HEALED

                    │
                    └─► Complete healing
                        Not partial
                        Not temporary
                        │
                        └─► Touch → Wholeness
                            │
                            └─► Jesus' garment = point of contact
                                Faith → Power released
```

**The Healing Pattern:**

```
GENNESARET HEALING
    │
    ├─ Recognition → News spreads
    ├─ Faith → Bring sick to Jesus
    ├─ Humility → "Just touch edge"
    └─► Contact → Complete healing
        │
        └─► This becomes pattern:
            │
            └─► Wherever Jesus goes
                Sick brought
                Faith touches
                Healing flows
                │
                └─► Mark 6:56: "Wherever he went—
                                 into villages, towns or countryside—
                                 they placed the sick in marketplaces.
                                 They begged him to let them
                                 touch even the edge of his cloak,
                                 and all who touched him were healed"
```

**The Chapter Ends on Abundance:**

```
JESUS' POWER DEMONSTRATED
    │
    ├─ PROVISION: 5 + 2 → 5,000 fed
    ├─ NATURE: Walks on water, calms storm
    └─► HEALING: Touch His garment → wholeness
        │
        └─► Every sphere of need
            Jesus meets abundantly
            │
            └─► Nothing too hard
                Nothing insufficient
                Nothing impossible
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I have faith to reach out and touch Jesus, even when feeling unworthy? Do I believe His presence heals?*

**One-line:** At Gennesaret, all who touch even Jesus' garment edge are completely healed—faith meets presence, wholeness flows.

```

## Diagnostic Summary

| Section | Core Question |
|---------|---------------|
| Martyrdom | Do I speak truth courageously or compromise to save face? |
| Provision | Do I bring my inadequacy to Jesus or hide it in shame? |
| Faith | When storms rage, do I focus on Christ or circumstances? |
| Touch | Do I reach out in faith or hold back from unworthiness? |

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Matthew 14:** After John's martyrdom, Jesus demonstrates divine power through feeding 5,000 from inadequate resources, walking on water while Peter's little faith both succeeds and fails, and healing all who touch His garment—revealing Him as the Son of God who provides abundantly, controls nature, and restores completely.

## Personal Notes

### John's Death Haunts Me

vv. 1-12 — This is brutal.

```
THE CONTRAST
    │
    ├─ JOHN: Speaks truth → beheaded
    └─► HEROD: Preserves image → destroys soul
        │
        └─► Which is worse?
            │
            └─► John dies but integrity intact
                Herod lives but conscience dead
```

John didn't soften the message: "Not lawful for you to have her."

Direct. Public. Costly.

**The cost:** Prison, then beheading.

**Herod's trap:**
- Wanted to kill John but feared people (v. 5)
- Caught by oath at party (v. 7)
- Chose saving face over prophet's life (v. 9)

**v. 9:** "The king was distressed."

He didn't WANT to kill John. But image management won.

```
THE QUESTION THIS RAISES FOR ME:
    │
    └─► How many times have I:
        │
        ├─ Softened truth to avoid offense
        ├─ Stayed silent to preserve relationship
        └─► Compromised conviction to save face
            │
            └─► I'm more Herod than John
                Fear of man > fear of God
```

**Prov 29:25:** "Fear of man will prove to be a snare."

Herod's snare: People's opinion trapped him in murder.

**Application:** Speak truth even when costly. Silence = slow compromise toward Herod's guilt.

### Jesus' Grief is Real

v. 13 — "When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew."

Jesus FELT John's death.

```
FULLY HUMAN
    │
    └─► He needed:
        ├─ Space to grieve
        ├─ Solitude with Father
        └─► Time to process loss
            │
            └─► Grief ≠ weak faith
                Grief = proof of love
```

But v. 14: Crowds interrupted His grief.

His response: **Compassion.**

```
THE TENSION:
    │
    ├─ Jesus needs rest
    └─► Crowds need healing
        │
        └─► Jesus chooses: Their need > His need
```

This convicts me. When I'm hurting, I protect my pain. "Leave me alone."

Jesus? Sees crowds, has compassion, heals their sick.

**Application:** My pain doesn't exempt me from compassion. Jesus grieved but still served.

### The Inadequate 5 + 2

vv. 17-21 — This miracle wrecks my scarcity mindset.

```
DISCIPLES' VIEW:
    │
    └─► "We have ONLY five loaves and two fish"
        │
        └─► Focus on inadequacy
            See impossibility
```

**Jesus' response:** "Bring them here to me."

Not: "Get more."
Not: "This won't work."

IS: "Give me what you have."

```
THE PRINCIPLE:
    │
    └─► Jesus multiplies what's GIVEN
        Not what's HOARDED
        │
        └─► They gave inadequate resources
            Jesus created abundance
            │
            └─► 5 + 2 → 5,000+ fed
                + 12 baskets left
```

**My problem:** I withhold inadequacy from Jesus.

```
I THINK:
    │
    └─► When I have MORE
        THEN I'll serve
        │
        └─► Better skills
            Better resources
            Better timing
            │
            └─► But "better" never comes
                And I never serve
```

**v. 18:** "Bring them here to me."

Bring WHAT YOU HAVE. However small.

**Application:** Stop waiting for adequacy. Bring inadequacy to Jesus. He creates from nothing.

### Peter's Little Faith

vv. 28-31 — Peter gets criticized, but he's the only one who LEFT THE BOAT.

```
PETER vs OTHER DISCIPLES:
    │
    ├─ 11 disciples: Stayed in boat (safe)
    └─► Peter: Got out (risky)
        │
        └─► Peter failed
            But he TRIED
```

**v. 30:** "When he saw the wind, he was afraid."

The fatal shift:
- Eyes on Jesus → walking
- Eyes on storm → sinking

**The pattern I see in my life:**

```
WHEN I SUCCEED:
    │
    └─► Focused on Jesus
        Obeying His word
        Ignoring impossibility
        │
        └─► I walk on water
            (Do impossible)

WHEN I FAIL:
    │
    └─► Focus shifts to circumstances
        See obstacles
        Fear rises
        │
        └─► I sink
```

**v. 31:** "Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him."

Even Peter's failure led to rescue + worship.

```
THE LESSON:
    │
    └─► Better to:
        │
        ├─ Step out in faith and fail
        └─► Than stay in boat and never try
            │
            └─► Peter's "little faith" still got him on water
                Other disciples' "safe faith" kept them in boat
```

**Application:**
- Keep eyes on Jesus, not circumstances
- Risk obedience even if might fail
- When sinking, cry "Lord, save!"

### Worship After Storm

v. 33 — "Truly you are the Son of God."

This is HUGE in Matthew.

```
CONFESSION PROGRESSION:
    │
    ├─ 8:27: "What kind of man is this?"
    │   └─► Question after calming storm
    │
    └─► 14:33: "Truly you are the Son of God"
        └─► Declaration after walking on water
```

Why worship here?

```
EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION:
    │
    ├─ Fed 5,000 from nothing (Creator)
    ├─ Walked on water (Divine)
    ├─ Calmed storm instantly (Sovereign)
    └─► Peter rescued immediately (Savior)
        │
        └─► Can't be mere man
            Must be GOD'S SON
```

**The disciples WORSHIPED.**

Not just respected. WORSHIPED (προσεκύνησαν).

This is reserved for God alone.

**Application:** Do I worship Jesus or just admire Him? Worship = bowing to deity, not applauding teacher.

### The Garment Touch

vv. 35-36 — "All who touched it were healed."

```
THE HUMILITY:
    │
    └─► "Just let them touch the EDGE"
        │
        └─► Not: "Command them healed"
            Not: "Touch them personally"
            │
            IS: "Just touch His garment"
                │
                └─► Smallest point of contact
                    Most remote part
                    │
                    └─► Faith doesn't demand
                        Faith reaches humbly
```

**The result:** 100% healing rate.

All who touched → healed.

**The principle:**

```
FAITH + PRESENCE = POWER
    │
    └─► Their faith: "Touching edge = enough"
        His presence: Power flows
        │
        └─► Result: Complete healing
```

**Woman with bleeding (9:20-22):** Same principle.

Touched garment → healed.

**Application:**
- Faith doesn't need elaborate prayers
- Simple touch in faith = enough
- Jesus' presence contains healing power

### The Chapter's Arc

```
MATTHEW 14 FLOW:
    │
    ├─ Starts: John's death (grief)
    ├─ Middle: Miracles (power)
    └─► Ends: Healing (restoration)
        │
        └─► From death → life
            From inadequacy → abundance
            From fear → worship
```

**Three impossibilities solved:**

1. **Provision:** Can't feed 10,000+ → Jesus creates from 5+2
2. **Nature:** Can't walk on water → Jesus defies physics
3. **Healing:** Can't cure diseases → Touch garment = wholeness

**The theme:** NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH JESUS.

```
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ME:
    │
    ├─ My inadequacy → His abundance
    ├─ My storms → His sovereignty
    └─► My sickness → His healing
        │
        └─► Bring impossibilities to Jesus
            He specializes in them
```

### Summary Thoughts

This chapter confronts my two greatest weaknesses:

**1. Fear of man (like Herod)**

Herod feared people's opinion more than God's judgment.

Result: Murdered prophet, haunted conscience.

**My version:**
- Soften truth to avoid conflict
- Stay silent to preserve relationships
- Compromise conviction for approval

**The cure:** Fear God more than man.

John spoke truth, paid price, died with integrity.

**2. Focus on circumstances (like Peter)**

Peter walked on water when focused on Jesus.

Sank when focused on storm.

**My version:**
- See obstacles → fear rises
- Calculate impossibility → faith shrinks
- Focus on lack → miss abundance

**The cure:** Keep eyes on Jesus.

"Bring them here to me" (v. 18).

Give Jesus my inadequacy. He creates from nothing.

**The call:**

Like John: Courage to speak truth.

Like Peter: Faith to leave boat.

Like crowds at Gennesaret: Humility to reach out and touch.

**v. 33:** "Truly you are the Son of God."

This is the confession the chapter builds toward.

Not "good teacher." Not "inspired prophet."

**SON OF GOD.**

Creator. Sovereign. Healer.

Do I worship Him as such?

Or just admire from boat, never risking, never touching?

**The challenge:** Get out of the boat.
