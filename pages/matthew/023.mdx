## The Three Movements

| Section | Focus | Core Principle |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Warning** (vv. 1-12) | Teaching vs practice | Authority is valid; hypocrisy is not |
| **Seven Woes** (vv. 13-36) | Specific indictments | Surface religion masks inner corruption |
| **Lament** (vv. 37-39) | Divine grief | God's offered protection vs Israel's rejection |

    │   └─► YOU: One Teacher, one Father, one Instructor
    │       │
    │       └─► GREATEST = SERVANT
    │           Exalt self → humbled

    │   │   └─► Tithe spices, neglect justice/mercy/faithfulness
    │   │       → "Strain gnat, swallow camel"
    │   │
    │   ├─► WOE #5 (vv. 25-26): Outside vs inside
    │   │   └─► Clean cup outside, greed inside

```

## The Denunciation Architecture

```
CHAPTER 22 ENDS:
    │
    └─► ALL OPPONENTS SILENCED (22:46)
        │
        └─► No more questions dared
            │
            NOW: Jesus takes initiative
            │
            CHAPTER 23 OPENS:
            │
            └─► Jesus SPEAKS TO crowds + disciples
                │
                ABOUT: The Pharisees
                │
                → Public denunciation
                  No longer answering traps
                  NOW: Exposing corruption

STRUCTURAL PATTERN:
    │
    ├─ INSTRUCTION (vv. 1-12)
    │   │
    │   └─► TO: Crowds + disciples
    │       │
    │       ABOUT: How to relate to religious leaders
    │       │
    │       ├─ Their AUTHORITY = valid
    │       │   └─► "Sit in Moses' seat"
    │       │       Do what they teach (Torah)
    │       │
    │       ├─ Their EXAMPLE = invalid
    │       │   └─► Don't imitate practice
    │       │       Words ≠ deeds
    │       │
    │       └─► Their MOTIVATION = corrupt
    │           └─► Everything for show
    │               Love titles, honor
    │               │
    │               CONTRAST: You must be servants
    │
    └─► INDICTMENT (vv. 13-36)
        │
        └─► TO: Pharisees directly
            │
            Seven formal "woes"
            │
            → Covenant curse formula
              Prophetic judgment speech
              │
              Not: anger venting
              IS: Judicial verdict
```

```
THE SEVEN WOES STRUCTURE:
    │
    └─► Pattern in each woe:
        │
        ├─ "WOE to you..."
        │   └─► Judgment announcement
        │
        ├─ "...teachers of the law and Pharisees"
        │   └─► Target identification
        │
        ├─ "...HYPOCRITES!"
        │   └─► Core accusation
        │
        └─► Specific charge + consequence
            │
            → Each woe exposes different failure mode

FAILURE MODES:
    │
    ├─ #1: Block access (v. 13)
    │   └─► Keep others OUT of kingdom
    │
    ├─ #2: Corrupt converts (v. 15)
    │   └─► Make others WORSE
    │
    ├─ #3: Distort oaths (vv. 16-22)
    │   └─► Twist TRUTH
    │
    ├─ #4: Invert priorities (vv. 23-24)
    │   └─► Major on MINOR
    │
    ├─ #5: Externalize religion (vv. 25-26)
    │   └─► SURFACE over substance
    │
    ├─ #6: Disguise death (vv. 27-28)
    │   └─► APPEARANCE vs reality
    │
    └─► #7: Repeat history (vv. 29-36)
        └─► Same PATTERN as ancestors
```

```
THE LAMENT STRUCTURE (vv. 37-39):
    │
    └─► Three movements:
        │
        ├─ GOD'S DESIRE (v. 37a)
        │   │
        │   └─► "How OFTEN I wanted..."
        │       │
        │       → Not: Once
        │         IS: Repeatedly
        │         │
        │         "Gather your children"
        │         │
        │         → Maternal image
        │           Hen + chicks
        │           │
        │           Protection, nurture
        │
        ├─ ISRAEL'S REFUSAL (v. 37b)
        │   │
        │   └─► "...you were NOT WILLING"
        │       │
        │       SAME VERB for both:
        │       │
        │       GOD willed → Israel would not
        │       │
        │       → Free refusal
        │         Not: God didn't want
        │         IS: Israel wouldn't have it
        │
        └─► RESULTING DESOLATION (vv. 38-39)
            │
            └─► "Your house is left to you DESOLATE"
                │
                ├─ Temple? House of Israel?
                │   Probably both
                │
                └─► Condition for restoration:
                    │
                    "Blessed is he who comes
                     in the name of the Lord"
                    │
                    Psalm 118:26
                    │
                    → Second coming?
                      National repentance?
                      │
                      → Future hope
                        But: Only through acknowledgment
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. Warning Against Hypocrisy (vv. 1-12)

```
THE SETTING (v. 1)
    │
    └─► "Then Jesus said to the crowds
         and to his disciples"
        │
        └─► Audience:
            │
            ├─ Crowds — General public
            └─► Disciples — Inner circle
                │
                → Both groups instructed
                  Public teaching
                  │
                  About: Religious leaders
                  Their authority
                  Their failure

MOSES' SEAT (vv. 2-3a)
    │
    └─► "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees
         sit in Moses' seat.
         So you must be careful
         to do everything they tell you"
        │
        └─► "Moses' seat"
            │
            ├─ LITERAL: Chair in synagogue
            │   └─► Where Torah read/taught
            │       Position of authority
            │       │
            │       Archaeological evidence:
            │       Stone seats found in synagogues
            │
            └─► FIGURATIVE: Teaching office
                │
                └─► Successors to Moses
                    Authoritative interpreters
                    │
                    → Their OFFICE = valid
                      Legitimate authority
                      │
                      Therefore: "Do what they tell you"
                      │
                      → Obey Torah teaching
                        Not: Their additions
                        IS: Moses' law they transmit

THE CONTRADICTION (v. 3b)
    │
    └─► "But do NOT do what they DO,
         for they do not practice what they preach"
        │
        └─► "They SAY and do NOT"
            │
            → Words ≠ Deeds
              Teaching ≠ Living
              │
              ├─ What they SAY: Valid (Moses' law)
              └─► What they DO: Invalid (hypocrisy)
                  │
                  → Disconnect defines them
                    This IS hypocrisy
```

**Burden Without Help (v. 4):**

```
HEAVY LOADS (v. 4)
    │
    └─► "They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads
         and put them on other people's shoulders,
         but they themselves are not willing
         to lift a finger to move them"
        │
        └─► What are these loads?
            │
            ├─ Extra regulations beyond Torah
            │   └─► Oral traditions
            │       Interpretive rules
            │       Fence around law
            │
            ├─ Ceremonial requirements
            │   └─► Ritual purity
            │       Sabbath restrictions
            │       Tithing minutiae
            │
            └─► Religious obligations
                │
                Without help or grace
                │
                → They impose
                  They don't assist
                  │
                  "Not willing to lift a FINGER"
                  │
                  → Minimal effort refused
                    Zero help given
                    │
                    Contrast: Matt 11:28-30
                    │
                    Jesus: "My yoke is EASY
                            my burden is LIGHT"
                    │
                    → Pharisees: Heavy + no help
                      Jesus: Light + with you
```

**Performance Religion (vv. 5-7):**

```
FOR SHOW (v. 5a)
    │
    └─► "Everything they do
         is done for people to SEE"
        │
        └─► Root word → "theater"
            │
            → Religion as performance
              Piety for audience
              │
              NOT: For God
              IS: For reputation

PHYLACTERIES (v. 5b)
    │
    └─► "They make their PHYLACTERIES wide"
        │
        └─► Small leather boxes
            │
            Worn during prayer
            │
            Contain Scripture:
            ├─ Exod 13:1-10
            ├─ Exod 13:11-16
            ├─ Deut 6:4-9
            └─► Deut 11:13-21
                │
                Based on: Deut 6:8
                "Tie them as symbols on your hands
                 and bind them on your foreheads"
                │
                → Physical reminder of Law
                  Literal application
                │
                PROBLEM: Making them WIDE
                │
                → Bigger = more pious?
                  Show off devotion
                  │
                  External marker
                  Not: Heart reality

TASSELS (v. 5c)
    │
    └─► "...and the TASSELS on their garments long"
        │
        └─► Based on: Num 15:38-40
            │
            "Speak to the Israelites and say to them:
             Throughout the generations to come
             you are to make tassels on the corners
             of your garments, with a blue cord"
            │
            PURPOSE: "You will remember
                      all the commands of the LORD"
            │
            → Memory device
              Visual reminder
              │
              PROBLEM: Making them LONG
              │
              → Exaggerated piety
                Look-at-me religion
                │
                Irony: Reminder of commands
                       While disobeying spirit

LOVE OF HONOR (vv. 6-7)
    │
    └─► "they love:
         - the place of honor at BANQUETS
         - the most important seats in SYNAGOGUES
         - to be greeted with respect in MARKETPLACES
         - to be called 'RABBI' by others"
        │
        └─► Four spheres:
            │
            ├─ SOCIAL (banquets)
            │   └─► Seat of honor at meals
            │
            ├─ RELIGIOUS (synagogues)
            │   └─► Prominent position
            │
            ├─ PUBLIC (marketplaces)
            │   └─► Public recognition
            │
            └─► PROFESSIONAL (title)
                └─► "Rabbi" = "My great one"
                    │
                    → They LOVE these things
                      │
                      → Heart exposed
                        Desire for status
                        Not: Service to God
                        IS: Service to ego
```

**Radical Alternative (vv. 8-12):**

```
TITLE PROHIBITION (vv. 8-10)
    │
    └─► Three forbidden titles:
        │
        ├─ "RABBI" (v. 8)
        │   │
        │   └─► "But YOU are not to be called 'Rabbi,'
        │        for you have ONE Teacher,
        │        and you are all BROTHERS"
        │       │
        │       Who? (Implied: Christ)
        │       │
        │       Result: All brothers
        │       │
        │       → Horizontal equality
        │         No hierarchy of teachers
        │
        ├─ "FATHER" (v. 9)
        │   │
        │   └─► "And do not call anyone on earth 'father,'
        │        for you have ONE Father,
        │        and he is in heaven"
        │       │
        │       Not: Biological father
        │       IS: Spiritual authority title
        │       │
        │       → One heavenly Father
        │         No human substitute
        │
        └─► "INSTRUCTOR" (v. 10)
            │
            └─► "Nor are you to be called instructors,
                 for you have ONE Instructor,
                 the Messiah"
                │
                → Ultimate authority in Christ alone

INTERPRETATION:
    │
    └─► Is this absolute prohibition?
        │
        ├─ Some say: NO titles ever
        │   └─► Never call anyone teacher, father, etc.
        │
        └─► Better reading: No titles for STATUS
            │
            ├─ Paul calls himself "father" (1 Cor 4:15)
            │   "I became your father through the gospel"
            │
            ├─ "Teachers" exist in church (Eph 4:11)
            │
            └─► Point: Don't seek honor through titles
                Don't create hierarchy of status
                │
                → All under ONE Teacher
                  All under ONE Father
                  All under ONE Instructor
                  │
                  = All brothers
                    Equal before God

THE REVERSAL PRINCIPLE (vv. 11-12)
    │
    └─► "The GREATEST among you
         will be your SERVANT.

         For those who EXALT themselves
         will be HUMBLED,
         and those who HUMBLE themselves
         will be EXALTED"
        │
        └─► INVERSION:
            │
            ├─ Greatness = service
            │   Not: Position, title, honor
            │
            └─► MECHANISM:
                │
                Self-exalt → God humbles
                Self-humble → God exalts
                │
                → Divine reversal
                  Kingdom economics
                  │
                  Same principle: Matt 20:26-28
                  │
                  "Whoever wants to be great
                   must be your servant"
                  │
                  → Jesus = supreme example
                    Phil 2:5-11
```

### 2. Seven Woes (vv. 13-36)

```
THE "WOE" FORMULA:
    │
    └─► Hebrew prophetic tradition
        │
        → Prophetic judgment cry
          │
          ├─ Isa 5:8,11,18,20,21,22: "Woe to you..."
          ├─ Amos 5:18; 6:1: "Woe to you..."
          ├─ Hab 2:6,9,12,15,19: "Woe to him..."
          │
          → Covenant curse
            Announcement of doom
            │
            Not: Emotional outburst
            IS: Formal indictment
            │
            Like: Prosecutor's charges
            Before: Divine court
```

**WOE #1 — Blocking the Kingdom (v. 13):**

```
THE CHARGE (v. 13)
    │
    └─► "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees,
         you HYPOCRITES!
         You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven
         in people's faces.
         You yourselves do not enter,
         nor will you let those enter who are trying to"
        │
        └─► TWO FAILURES:
            │
            ├─ "You yourselves do NOT ENTER"
            │   │
            │   → Rejected Jesus
            │     Rejected kingdom
            │     Outside themselves
            │
            └─► "Nor let those TRYING to enter"
                │
                → People seeking God
                  Being turned away
                  │
                  HOW?
                  │
                  ├─ False teaching
                  ├─ Impossible standards
                  ├─ Rejection of Messiah
                  └─► Leading away from Jesus
                      │
                      → Double failure:
                        Miss it themselves
                        Cause others to miss it
```

**WOE #2 — Corrupting Converts (v. 15):**

```
THE CHARGE (v. 15)
    │
    └─► "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees,
         you hypocrites!
         You travel over LAND and SEA
         to win a single CONVERT,
         and when you have succeeded,
         you make them TWICE as much
         a child of HELL as you are"
        │
        └─► MISSIONARY ZEAL:
            │
            → Enormous effort
              Great distances
              To win ONE convert
              │
              → Dedication? Yes
                But: Misdirected

            THE RESULT:
            │
            └─► Convert becomes WORSE
                than teachers
                │
                WHY?
                │
                ├─ Converts often more zealous
                │   Than those born into tradition
                │
                ├─ Learn the WORST parts
                │   Of Pharisaic system
                │
                └─► Adopt hypocrisy
                    Without cultural restraints
                    │
                    → Multiplication of evil
                      Not: Kingdom growth
                      IS: Hell's expansion
```

**WOE #3 — Twisted Oaths (vv. 16-22):**

```
THE CHARGE (v. 16)
    │
    └─► "Woe to you, BLIND GUIDES!
         You say, 'If anyone swears by the TEMPLE,
         it means nothing;
         but anyone who swears by the GOLD of the temple
         is bound by that oath'"
        │
        └─► "BLIND guides"
            │
            → Guides who can't see
              Lead into ditches (15:14)
              │
              THE PROBLEM:
              │
              └─► Casuistry about oaths
                  │
                  ├─ Swear by TEMPLE → Not binding
                  └─► Swear by GOLD → Binding
                      │
                      → Created loopholes
                        Escape clauses
                        Technicalities to evade truth

THE REBUKE (v. 17)
    │
    └─► "You BLIND FOOLS!
         Which is greater:
         the GOLD, or the TEMPLE
         that makes the gold sacred?"
        │
        └─► THE LOGIC:
            │
            └─► TEMPLE sanctifies gold
                Not: Gold sanctifies temple
                │
                Container > Contents
                Sanctifier > Sanctified
                │
                → They have it BACKWARDS

THE CORRECTION (vv. 20-22)
    │
    └─► THREE SWEARINGS:
        │
        ├─ By ALTAR
        │   └─► = By altar + everything on it
        │       Can't separate
        │
        ├─ By TEMPLE
        │   └─► = By temple + GOD who dwells there
        │       → God's presence makes temple holy
        │
        └─► By HEAVEN
            └─► = By God's throne + GOD on it
                │
                → All oaths ultimately invoke God
                  No escape clause
                  │
                  Better: Don't swear at all (5:34-37)
                  "Let your 'Yes' be 'Yes'"
```

**WOE #4 — Inverted Priorities (vv. 23-24):**

```
THE CHARGE (v. 23)
    │
    └─► "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees,
         you hypocrites!
         You give a TENTH of your spices—
         mint, dill and cumin.
         But you have NEGLECTED
         the more important matters of the law—
         JUSTICE, MERCY and FAITHFULNESS.
         You should have practiced the latter,
         without neglecting the former"
        │
        └─► WHAT THEY DO:
            │
            Tithe herbs, spices
            Small garden produce
            │
            Tithing these = extreme scrupulousness
            │
            Deut 14:22: Tithe "all the produce"
            │
            They extend to smallest herbs

            WHAT THEY NEGLECT:
            │
            └─► "The weightier things of the law"
                │
                THREE WEIGHTS:
                │
                ├─ JUSTICE
                │   └─► Right judgment
                │       Fair dealings
                │       Defense of oppressed
                │
                ├─ MERCY
                │   └─► Compassion
                │       Forgiveness
                │       Care for suffering
                │
                └─► FAITHFULNESS
                    │
                    └─► Reliability
                        Covenant loyalty
                        Trustworthiness
                        │
                        → Micah 6:8:
                          "Act justly
                           love mercy
                           walk humbly with God"
                          │
                          SAME trio

            THE BALANCE:
            │
            └─► "Should have practiced latter
                 without neglecting former"
                │
                → Both/and
                  Not: Either/or
                  │
                  Tithe? Yes
                  Justice, mercy, faithfulness? FIRST
                  │
                  → Priority, not exclusion

THE METAPHOR (v. 24)
    │
    └─► "You BLIND guides!
         You strain out a GNAT
         but swallow a CAMEL"
        │
        └─► GNAT: Smallest unclean flying insect
            │
            Pharisees would strain wine
            Through cloth filter
            To avoid swallowing gnat
            (Unclean: Lev 11:20-23)

            CAMEL: Largest unclean land animal
            In Palestine (Lev 11:4)
            │
            → Absurd image:
              │
              Carefully filter tiny gnat
              While gulping down whole camel
              │
              = Extreme scrupulousness on minor
                Total neglect of major
                │
                → Inverted priorities
                  Meticulous on small
                  Blind on large
```

**WOE #5 — External Cleansing (vv. 25-26):**

```
THE CHARGE (v. 25)
    │
    └─► "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees,
         you hypocrites!
         You clean the OUTSIDE of the cup and dish,
         but INSIDE they are full of
         GREED and SELF-INDULGENCE"
        │
        └─► IMAGERY:
            │
            Cup + dish
            │
            → Ritual purity concern
              Pharisees meticulous about
              External cleanliness of vessels
              │
              BUT: Inside full of...
              │
              ├─ Greed — Seizing what's not yours
              │
              └─► Self-indulgence — Lack of self-control
                  │
                  → Heart problem
                    Not: Dirty dishes
                    IS: Dirty hearts

THE SOLUTION (v. 26)
    │
    └─► "Blind Pharisee!
         First clean the INSIDE of the cup and dish,
         and then the OUTSIDE also will be clean"
        │
        └─► ORDER matters:
            │
            FIRST: Inside
            THEN: Outside will follow
            │
            → Interior → Exterior
              Heart → Behavior
              Being → Doing
              │
              ├─ Clean heart → Clean life
              └─► Dirty heart + clean exterior = HYPOCRISY
                  │
                  → True religion works inside-out
                    Not: Outside-in
```

**WOE #6 — Whitewashed Tombs (vv. 27-28):**

```
THE CHARGE (v. 27)
    │
    └─► "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees,
         you hypocrites!
         You are like WHITEWASHED TOMBS,
         which look BEAUTIFUL on the outside
         but on the inside are full of
         the BONES of the dead
         and everything UNCLEAN"
        │
        └─► BACKGROUND:
            │
            Tombs whitewashed before Passover
            │
            WHY?
            │
            └─► Num 19:16: "Anyone who touches
                           human bone or grave
                           will be unclean seven days"
                │
                → During pilgrimage festivals
                  Masses travel to Jerusalem
                  Could accidentally touch tomb
                  → Defiled for feast
                  │
                  SOLUTION: Whitewash tombs
                  Make them visible
                  So people avoid them
                  │

                    │
                    → Death, decay, corruption

THE APPLICATION (v. 28)
    │
    └─► "In the same way,
         on the OUTSIDE you appear to people
         as RIGHTEOUS
         but on the INSIDE you are full of
         HYPOCRISY and WICKEDNESS"
        │
        └─► PARALLEL:
            │
            ├─ Whitewash = Appearance of righteousness
            │
            └─► Inside = Reality

                    Irony: They're LAW experts
                           But LAWLESS inside
                    │
                    → Most religious = most corrupt?
                      Surface hides rot

**WOE #7 — Prophet Killers (vv. 29-36):**

THE CHARGE (vv. 29-30)
    │
    └─► "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees,
         you hypocrites!
         You build TOMBS for the prophets
         and decorate the GRAVES of the righteous.

                  │
                  = Distance from ancestors' crimes
                  "WE wouldn't have done that"

THE EXPOSURE (vv. 31-32)
    │
    └─► "So you TESTIFY against yourselves
         that you are the DESCENDANTS
         of those who murdered the prophets.
         Go ahead, then, and COMPLETE
         what your ancestors started!"
        │
        └─► SELF-INCRIMINATION:
            │
            "You witness against yourselves"
            │
            HOW?
            │
            └─► "Descendants of those who murdered"
                │
                Not just: Biological descent
                IS: Spiritual continuity
                │
                → Same spirit
                  Same pattern
                  │
                  "COMPLETE what ancestors started"
                  │
                  "Fill up the measure"
                  │
                  → They will kill Jesus
                    They will kill his messengers
                    │
                    = Proving they're same as ancestors
                    │
                    → Ironic command:
                      "Go ahead, finish it"

THE VERDICT (v. 33)
    │
    └─► "You SNAKES!
         You brood of VIPERS!
         How will you escape being condemned to HELL?"
        │
        └─► "Offspring of vipers"
            │
            → Same language: John the Baptist (3:7)
              │
              Serpent = Satan imagery (Gen 3)
              │
              → Children of devil
                Not: Children of Abraham (as claimed)
                │
                → Rhetorical question
                  Answer: You won't

THE PROPHECY (vv. 34-36)
    │
    └─► "Therefore I am sending you
         PROPHETS and SAGES and TEACHERS.
         Some of them you will KILL and CRUCIFY;
         others you will FLOG in your synagogues
         and pursue from town to town.
         And so upon you will come
         ALL the righteous blood
         that has been shed on earth,
         from the blood of righteous ABEL
         to the blood of ZECHARIAH son of Berekiah,
         whom you murdered
         between the temple and the altar.
         Truly I tell you,
         all this will come on THIS GENERATION"
        │
        └─► JESUS SENDS:
            │
            "I send" — Emphatic
            │
            → Divine prerogative
              Like God sending prophets (OT)
              │
              WHOM?
              │
              → Christian leaders to come
                Apostles, teachers

            THEIR FATE:
            │
            ├─ Kill
            ├─ Crucify
            ├─ Flog
            └─► Persecute
                │
                → Prediction: Christian persecution
                  Acts fulfills this
                  (Stephen killed, apostles flogged)

            THE BLOOD GUILT:
            │
            └─► "From ABEL to ZECHARIAH"
                │
                ├─ ABEL: First martyr (Gen 4)
                │   └─► Killed by brother Cain

                    │
                    Killed in temple court
                    Last martyr in Hebrew canon
                    │
                    (Hebrew Bible ends with Chronicles)
                    │
                    → "Alpha to Omega" of martyrs
                      First to last
                      ALL righteous blood
                      │
                      "THIS GENERATION" will bear it
                      │
                      → AD 70: Temple destroyed
                        Nation scattered
                        │
                        = Accumulated judgment

### 3. Lament Over Jerusalem (vv. 37-39)

```
THE CRY (v. 37a)
    │
    └─► "Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
         you who kill the prophets
         and stone those sent to you"
        │
        └─► Repetition: "Jerusalem, Jerusalem"
            │
            → Emotional intensity
              Deep grief
              Personal address
              │
              Same pattern:
              ├─ "Martha, Martha" (Luke 10:41)
              ├─ "Simon, Simon" (Luke 22:31)
              └─► "Saul, Saul" (Acts 9:4)
                  │
                  → Tender, sorrowful

            THE ACCUSATION:
            │
            ├─ "The one killing the prophets"
            └─► "Stoning those sent"
                │
                → Present participles
                  Ongoing character
                  │
                  Not: Past mistake
                  IS: Defining pattern
                  │
                  → City of prophet-murder

GOD'S DESIRE (v. 37b)
    │
    └─► "how often I have longed
         to GATHER your children together,
         as a HEN gathers her CHICKS under her wings,
         and you were not willing"
        │
        └─► "How many times I wanted"
            │
            → FREQUENCY emphasized
              Not: Once
              IS: Repeatedly
              │
              Over and over
              Through prophets
              Through history
              Now: Through Jesus himself

            THE IMAGE:
            │
            └─► Hen gathering chicks under wings
                │
                → MATERNAL image for God
                  (Unusual in Jesus' teaching)
                  │
                  ├─ Protection from predator
                  │   └─► Hawk overhead
                  │       Chicks run to mother
                  │       Hidden under wings
                  │
                  ├─ Warmth in cold
                  │   └─► Feathers insulate
                  │       Body heat shared
                  │
                  └─► Nurture
                      └─► Close to mother
                          Safe place
                      │
                      OT echoes:
                      │
                      ├─ Deut 32:11: "Like eagle... spreads wings"
                      ├─ Ruth 2:12: "Under whose wings you came"
                      ├─ Ps 17:8: "Hide me in shadow of your wings"

                          │
                          → God as protective bird
                            Gathering, sheltering
                            │
                            Jesus claims this role
                            = Divine claim

            THE REFUSAL:
            │
            └─► "And you were NOT WILLING"
                │
                CRITICAL: Same verb both times
                │
                ├─ God WANTED (willed)
                └─► Israel WOULD NOT (willed not)
                    │
                    → Sovereign desire
                      Human refusal
                      │
                      NOT: God couldn't
                      IS: They wouldn't
                      │
                      → Tragedy of free rejection
                        God's longing spurned

THE CONSEQUENCE (v. 38)
    │
    └─► "Look, your house is left to you DESOLATE"
        │
        └─► "Your house is left to you desolate"
            │
            ├─ "Left, abandoned" — Present tense: Being left NOW
            │
            ├─ "House"
            │   │
            │   ├─ Temple? (God's house)
            │   ├─ Jerusalem? (City as house)
            │   └─► Israel? (House of Israel)
            │       │
            │       → Probably: All three
            │         Encompassing judgment
            │
            └─► "Desolate, abandoned"
                │
                → God's presence departing
                  │
                  Ezek 10-11: Glory leaves temple
                  │
                  Now: Jesus (God incarnate) leaves
                  │
                  → Desolation follows
                    AD 70: Physical destruction

THE CONDITION (v. 39)
    │
    └─► "For I tell you,
         you will not see me again until you say,
         'Blessed is he who comes
         in the name of the Lord'"
        │
        └─► "You will certainly not see me from now"
            │
            Strong negation
            │
            → Definite departure

            THE CONDITION:
            │
            "UNTIL you say"
            │
            → Implies: WILL say eventually
              Future acknowledgment
              │
              WHAT will they say?
              │
              Psalm 118:26:
              │
              "Blessed is he who comes
               in the name of the Lord"
               │
               → Same words: Palm Sunday (21:9)
                 │
                 Then: Crowds shouted (many)
                 Future: Israel will acknowledge
                 │
                 WHEN?

                 ├─ Second Coming?
                 │   └─► National recognition at return

                 └─► Individual salvation?
                     └─► Whenever Jews accept Jesus
                         │
                         → Probably: Eschatological
                           Final recognition
                           When Christ returns
                           │
                           → Hope embedded in judgment
                             Not: Final rejection
                             IS: Temporary blindness

## Unified Framework

```
MATTHEW 23 ARCHITECTURE:
    │
    ├─ INSTRUCTION (vv. 1-12)
    │   │
    │   └─► To crowds + disciples
    │       │
    │       ABOUT: Religious leaders
    │       │
    │       ├─ Their authority = valid

## The Anatomy of Hypocrisy

```
WHAT IS "HYPOCRITE"?
    │
    └─► Greek: hypokritēs
        │
        Etymology (THIS MATTERS):
        │
        ├─ Original: "One who answers"
        │
        └─► Became: "Stage actor"
            │
            └─► One who plays a part
                Wears a mask
                Performs a role
                │
                → Not what they appear
                  The word literally means ACTOR

THE SEVEN FACES OF HYPOCRISY (from the woes):
    │
    ├─ #1: GATEKEEPING HYPOCRISY
    │   │
    │   └─► Claim to open doors
    │       Actually close them
    │       │
    │       → Religious authority used
    │         To exclude rather than include
    │
    ├─ #2: MULTIPLYING HYPOCRISY
    │   │
    │   └─► Zealous to make converts
    │       Convert them to corruption
    │       │
    │       → Activity ≠ fruit
    │         Numbers ≠ health
    │
    ├─ #3: LEGALISTIC HYPOCRISY
    │   │
    │   └─► Expert in technicalities
    │       Use them to evade truth
    │       │
    │       → Knowledge used for loopholes
    │         Law-expertise serves lawlessness
    │
    ├─ #4: SELECTIVE HYPOCRISY
    │   │
    │   └─► Meticulous on minor
    │       Careless on major
    │       │
    │       → Cherry-pick easy obedience
    │         Neglect costly commands
    │
    ├─ #5: SURFACE HYPOCRISY
    │   │
    │   └─► Clean outside
    │       Corrupt inside
    │       │
    │       → Image management
    │         Interior neglected
    │
    ├─ #6: DECORATIVE HYPOCRISY
    │   │
    │   └─► Beautiful exterior
    │       Death interior
    │       │
    │       → Tomb religion
    │         Looks alive, actually dead
    │
    └─► #7: HISTORICAL HYPOCRISY
        │
        └─► Condemn ancestors
            Repeat their sins
            │
            → "We're different"
              While being same

THE COMMON STRUCTURE:
    │
    └─► All hypocrisy = GAP
        │
        Between: Appearance ↔ Reality
                 Words ↔ Deeds
                 Outside ↔ Inside
                 Past ↔ Present
                 Claim ↔ Character
                 │
                 → The gap IS the hypocrisy

THE OPPOSITE OF HYPOCRISY:
    │
    └─► INTEGRITY
        │
        From: Latin "integer" = whole, complete
        │
        → No gap
          What you see = what is
          Inside = outside
          │
          Jesus' call:
          │
          "First clean the INSIDE...
           then the outside also will be clean"
          │
          → Work from center out
            Not: Surface management

## Diagnostic Summary

```
INSTRUCTION QUESTION (vv. 1-12):
    │
    └─► How should you relate to religious leaders?
        │
        THREE PRINCIPLES:
        │
        ├─ OBEY their teaching (Moses' seat)
        │   └─► When it accords with Scripture
        │       Not: Their additions
        │       IS: The Law they transmit
        │
        ├─ DON'T imitate their practice
        │   └─► Words without deeds = hypocrisy
        │       Don't copy what contradicts
        │
        └─► DON'T seek their status
            │
            └─► No titles for honor
                No hierarchy for ego
                │
                → One Teacher (Christ)
                  One Father (God)
                  One Instructor (Messiah)
                  │
                  All brothers
                  Greatest = servant

WOE QUESTION (vv. 13-36):
    │
    └─► What makes religious leadership corrupt?
        │
        SEVEN FAILURE MODES:
        │
        ├─ #1: Use authority to EXCLUDE
        │   └─► Block what you should open
        │
        ├─ #2: Make followers WORSE
        │   └─► Multiply your corruption
        │
        ├─ #3: Create LOOPHOLES
        │   └─► Use expertise to evade
        │
        ├─ #4: Major on MINORS
        │   └─► Tithe herbs, neglect justice
        │
        ├─ #5: Focus on OUTSIDE
        │   └─► Ignore the inside
        │
        ├─ #6: DECORATE death
        │   └─► Beautiful exterior, rotten interior
        │
        └─► #7: REPEAT what you condemn
            └─► Same spirit as ancestors

        COMMON THREAD:
        │
        └─► DISCONNECTION
            │
            Between what is shown
            And what is real
            │
            → Hypocrisy in every case

LAMENT QUESTION (vv. 37-39):
    │
    └─► Why does judgment come?
        │
        NOT: Because God doesn't care
        │
        IS: Because God cared + was refused
        │
        ├─ "How OFTEN I wanted to gather you"
        │   └─► Repeated desire
        │       Multiple opportunities
        │
        ├─ "You were NOT WILLING"
        │   └─► Human refusal
        │       Chosen rejection
        │
        └─► "Your house is left DESOLATE"
            └─► Natural consequence
                Of refusing protection
                │
                → God's judgment = giving over
                  To what they chose
                  │
                  Rom 1:24,26,28: "God gave them over..."
```

```
THE CHAPTER'S SINGLE THREAD:
    │
    └─► AUTHENTICITY vs PERFORMANCE
        │
        ├─ Pharisees: All performance
        │   │
        │   ├─ Wide phylacteries (seen)
        │   ├─ Long tassels (seen)
        │   ├─ Honor at banquets (seen)
        │   ├─ Clean cup outside (seen)
        │   └─► Whitewashed tomb (seen)
        │       │
        │       All external
        │       All for audience
        │       All without substance
        │
        └─► Jesus' call: Interior first
            │
            ├─ Be servant (not honored)
            ├─ Clean inside (not outside)
            ├─ Justice, mercy, faithfulness (not herbs)
            └─► Acknowledge reality (not deny)
                │
                → Truth from center
                  Authenticity from within

APPLICATION FLOW:
    │
    └─► WHERE do you have gaps?
        │
        Between:
        │
        ├─ What you SAY ↔ What you DO
        ├─ What you SHOW ↔ What you ARE
        ├─ What you CONDEMN ↔ What you PRACTICE
        └─► What you KNOW ↔ What you LIVE
            │
            → The gap = hypocrisy
              │
              SOLUTION:
              │
              Not: Better performance
              IS: Interior transformation
              │
              "First clean the INSIDE..."
```

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Jesus exposes hypocrisy as the gap between appearance and reality—warning crowds not to imitate religious leaders who burden others, seek honor, and perform externally while corrupted internally—pronouncing seven woes that indict their gatekeeping, corruption, oath-twisting, priority-inversion, surface-cleaning, tomb-decorating, and prophet-killing—before lamenting Jerusalem's refusal of God's repeated longing to gather and protect them, leaving their house desolate until they finally acknowledge him.**

## Personal Notes

### The Seat vs The Person

```
CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
    │
    ├─ OFFICE (Moses' seat) → Valid
    │   └─► Obey the teaching
    │       (When it's Moses' Law)
    │
    └─► EXAMPLE (their practice) → Invalid
        └─► Don't imitate conduct
            (When it contradicts)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
    │
    └─► Authority can be legitimate
        While person is hypocritical
        │
        ├─ A corrupt judge still has authority
        ├─ A hypocritical teacher still teaches truth
        └─► An immoral preacher still preaches Scripture
            │
            → Don't dismiss truth
              Because of messenger
              │
              BUT: Don't follow example
              Of contradiction

MODERN APPLICATION:
    │
    └─► Church leaders may teach truth
        While living falsely
        │
        ├─ Receive the truth
        └─► Don't imitate the falseness
            │
            → Discernment required
```

### The Servant Paradox

```
KINGDOM ECONOMICS:
    │
    └─► Up = Down
        First = Last
        Greatest = Servant
        │
        ├─ Self-exaltation → Humbled (by God)
        └─► Self-humbling → Exalted (by God)
            │
            → Inverted status system

WHY THIS WORKS:
    │
    └─► God resists pride (James 4:6)
        God gives grace to humble
        │
        ├─ Pride = competition with God
        │   └─► God opposes
        │
        └─► Humility = dependence on God
            └─► God lifts up

THE JESUS WAY:
    │
    └─► Greatness through:
        │
        └─► SERVICE
            │
            → Table servant
              The one who waits on others
              │
              Not: Waited upon
              IS: Waiting upon
              │
              Phil 2:5-11:
              │
              Christ "made himself nothing,
                     taking form of servant...
                     humbled himself...
                     Therefore God EXALTED him
                     to the highest place"
              │
              → Downward leads upward
                (When God does the lifting)
```

### The Gnat and Camel

```
THE IMAGE:
    │
    ├─ GNAT — Smallest unclean flying thing
    │   └─► Filter wine through cloth
    │       So you don't swallow it
    │
    └─► CAMEL — Largest unclean land animal
        └─► Impossible to miss
            Yet: "swallowed"

THE ABSURDITY:
    │
    └─► Meticulously strain out tiny gnat
        While gulping down whole camel
        │
        → Extreme care on trivial
          Total blindness on massive
          │
          Like:
          │
          ├─ Carefully counting tithe of herbs
          │   While neglecting justice
          │
          ├─ Obsessing over ritual purity
          │   While full of greed
          │
          └─► Decorating prophet tombs
              While planning to kill the Prophet

MODERN GNATS & CAMELS:
    │
    └─► Wherever we're meticulous on small
        While ignoring large:
        │
        ├─ Perfect church attendance
        │   + Unforgiving heart
        │
        ├─ Correct doctrine on details
        │   + No love for neighbor
        │
        ├─ Moral on visible issues
        │   + Corrupt in hidden areas
        │
        └─► Careful religious observance
            + Neglecting justice, mercy, faithfulness
            │
            → Ask: What's my camel?
              Where am I straining gnats?
```

### The Hen and Chicks

```
THE IMAGE:
    │
    └─► Hen gathering chicks under wings
        │
        → MATERNAL image for God
          (Unusual in Jesus' teaching)
          │
          ├─ Protection from predator
          │   └─► Hawk overhead
          │       Chicks run to mother
          │       Hidden under wings
          │
          ├─ Warmth in cold
          │   └─► Feathers insulate
          │       Body heat shared
          │
          └─► Nurture
              └─► Close to mother
                  Safe place

WHY THIS IMAGE HERE?
    │
    └─► After seven woes (judgment)
        Comes lament (grief)
        │
        → God's heart exposed:
          │
          ├─ Not: Angry judge eager to condemn
          └─► IS: Grieving mother longing to protect
              │
              The judgment IS the rejected protection
              │
              → They refused the wings
                Now exposed to destruction

THE TRAGEDY:
    │
    └─► "I wanted"
        "You would not"
        │
        SAME VERB for both
        │
        ├─ Divine will: To gather
        └─► Human will: To refuse
            │
            → Theological mystery:
              │
              God's desire ≠ automatic
              Human refusal possible
              │
              Yet: God's purposes not defeated
              Only: This generation's judgment

THE FUTURE HOPE:
    │
    └─► "UNTIL you say..."
        │
        → Condition implies fulfillment
          Will say eventually
          │
          "Blessed is he who comes
           in the name of the Lord"
          │
          → Second coming?
            National repentance?
            Both?
            │
            → Hope within judgment
              End is not final
              Until acknowledgment comes
```
