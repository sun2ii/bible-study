    ├─ vv. 1-20   HEART vs TRADITION → What truly defiles
    │   ├─► Pharisees question hand-washing
    │   ├─► Jesus exposes Corban abuse
    │   ├─► Heart produces evil, not food
    │   └─► Internal condition > external ritual

            Jesus provides abundantly, again
```

## The Central Question

```
WHAT MATTERS TO GOD?
    │
    ├─ Religious leaders say: EXTERNAL PURITY
    │   └─► Wash hands (tradition)
    │       Follow rituals
    │       Preserve customs
    │
    └─► Jesus says: INTERNAL PURITY
        │

            Faith response
            Love of God > love of tradition
            │
            └─► The contrast:
                │

                └─► Canaanite: Unclean ethnicity, great faith
                    │
                    └─► Which does God honor?
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. Tradition vs God's Command (vv. 1-20) — HEART OVER RITUAL

**Key Greek:**
- παράδοσις (paradosis) — "tradition, what is handed down"
- κοινόω (koinoō) — "to make common, defile"
- ὑπόκρισις (hypokrisis) — "hypocrisy, play-acting"

```
THE CONFRONTATION (vv. 1-2)
    │
    └─► "Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law
         came to Jesus from JERUSALEM and asked,
         'Why do your disciples BREAK THE TRADITION of the elders?
          They don't WASH THEIR HANDS before they eat!'"
        │
        └─► The accusation:
            │
            ├─ Source: Jerusalem (religious headquarters)
            │   └─► Pharisees + teachers
            │       Official delegation
            │       Coming to investigate Jesus
            │
            ├─ Charge: Breaking TRADITION
            │   └─► παράδοσις τῶν πρεσβυτέρων
            │       "Tradition of the elders"
            │       │
            │       └─► NOT breaking Scripture
            │           Breaking HUMAN tradition
            │           │
            │           └─► Oral law (later codified in Mishnah)
            │               Washing hands = ritual purity
            │               Not hygiene, ceremonial
            │
            └─► The specific issue: Unwashed hands
                │
                └─► Mark 7:3-4 explains:
                    "Pharisees and all Jews do not eat
                     unless they give hands ceremonial washing,
                     holding to tradition of elders.
                     When they come from marketplace,
                     they do not eat unless they wash."
                    │
                    └─► Ritual washing before meals
                        To remove ceremonial defilement
                        From contact with Gentiles/market
                        │
                        └─► Tradition elevated to COMMAND
                            Human rule = divine requirement
```

**The Tradition System:**

```
HOW TRADITION WORKS
    │
    └─► Pharisees built "fence around Torah"
        │
        ├─ Torah command: "Be holy"
        ├─ Tradition adds: Wash hands ritually
        └─► Logic: Extra rules prevent breaking God's law
            │
            └─► Problem:
                │
                └─► Traditions become EQUAL to Scripture
                    Eventually SUPERIOR to Scripture
                    │
                    └─► Human rules replace divine commands
                        This is Jesus' charge (v. 3)
```

```
JESUS' COUNTER-ACCUSATION (v. 3)
    │
    └─► "Jesus replied,
         'And why do YOU break the COMMAND OF GOD
          for the sake of YOUR TRADITION?'"
        │
        └─► Jesus flips the accusation:
            │
            └─► They accuse: "Your disciples break tradition"
                Jesus counters: "YOU break God's command"
                │
                └─► The contrast:
                    │
                    ├─ Their concern: Human tradition
                    └─► Jesus' concern: Divine command
                        │
                        └─► Which matters more?
                            │
                            └─► God's explicit word
                                Or human interpretation?
```

```
THE CORBAN EXAMPLE (vv. 4-6)
    │
    ├─ God's command cited (v. 4):
    │   │
    │   └─► "For GOD SAID,
    │        'Honor your father and mother'
    │        and 'Anyone who curses father or mother
    │             is to be put to death'"
    │       │
    │       └─► Double citation:
    │           │
    │           ├─ Exodus 20:12 — Fifth Commandment
    │           │   └─► "Honor your father and mother"
    │           │       Active duty to care for parents
    │           │
    │           └─► Exodus 21:17 — Capital punishment
    │               │
    │               └─► Cursing parents = death penalty
    │                   Shows SERIOUSNESS of command
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Honoring parents = NOT OPTIONAL
    │                       Core divine requirement
    │
    ├─ Their tradition contradicts (v. 5):
    │   │
    │   └─► "But YOU say that if anyone declares
    │        that what might have been used to help father or mother
    │        is 'DEVOTED TO GOD' (CORBAN),
    │        they are not to honor their father or mother with it"
    │       │
    │       └─► κορβᾶν (korban) — "gift, offering devoted to God"
    │           │
    │           └─► The loophole:
    │               │
    │               ├─ Parent needs financial help
    │               ├─ Son says: "This money is CORBAN"
    │               │   └─► "Devoted to temple/God"
    │               │       Can't be used for secular purposes
    │               │
    │               └─► Result:
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Son keeps money himself
    │                       But claims it's "holy"
    │                       Therefore can't help parents
    │                       │
    │                       └─► Tradition provided ESCAPE CLAUSE
    │                           From God's clear command
    │
    └─► The verdict (v. 6a):
        │
        └─► "Thus you NULLIFY THE WORD OF GOD
             for the sake of your tradition"
            │
            └─► ἀκυρόω (akyroō) — "invalidate, make void"
                │
                └─► Tradition CANCELS Scripture
                    │
                    └─► God says: "Honor parents"
                        Tradition allows: "Call it Corban, keep money"
                        │
                        └─► Using "piety" to avoid obedience
                            Religious language masks disobedience
```

**Corban Abuse Pattern:**

```
THE CORBAN SCAM
    │
    ├─ God's command: Honor parents (care for them)
    ├─ Tradition: Money devoted to God is holy
    └─► Abuse: Declare money "Corban"
        │
        └─► Keep it yourself
            But claim you CAN'T help parents
            (Money is "God's")
            │
            └─► Piety = excuse for greed
                Religious language = financial selfishness
                │
                └─► Josephus confirms this practice
                    Common abuse in Jesus' day
```

```
THE HYPOCRISY DIAGNOSIS (vv. 7-9)
    │
    ├─ The accusation (v. 7):
    │   │
    │   └─► "You HYPOCRITES! Isaiah was right
    │        when he prophesied about you"
    │       │
    │       └─► ὑποκριταί (hypokritai) — "actors, pretenders"
    │           │
    │           └─► Not: "You made a mistake"
    │               IS: "You're PLAY-ACTING"
    │               │
    │               └─► Pretending to be godly
    │                   While violating God's commands
    │
    └─► The prophecy (vv. 8-9, quoting Isaiah 29:13):
        │
        └─► "'These people HONOR ME WITH THEIR LIPS,
              but their HEARTS ARE FAR FROM ME.
              They worship me IN VAIN;
              their teachings are merely HUMAN RULES'"
            │
            └─► Three indictments:
                │
                ├─ LIP SERVICE without heart
                │   └─► External religion
                │       Internal distance
                │       │
                │       └─► Mouth says "Lord, Lord"
                │           Heart says "My will, not Yours"
                │
                ├─ VAIN WORSHIP
                │   └─► μάτην (matēn) — "in vain, uselessly"
                │       │
                │       └─► Their worship = EMPTY
                │           God doesn't accept it
                │           │
                │           └─► Because heart is absent
                │               Going through motions
                │               But no love, no submission
                │
                └─► HUMAN RULES taught as doctrine
                    │
                    └─► Traditions elevated to Scripture
                        Man's commands = God's requirements
                        │
                        └─► This is the core problem:
                            │
                            └─► Replacing God's word
                                With human tradition
                                │
                                └─► Then demanding obedience
                                    To what GOD NEVER SAID
```

**The Isaiah Diagnosis:**

| Element | Isaiah 29:13 | Pharisees (Matt 15) |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Speech** | Honor with lips | Quote Scripture, teach tradition |
| **Heart** | Far from God | Love tradition > love God |
| **Worship** | Vain/empty | Elaborate rituals without faith |
| **Teaching** | Human rules | Corban, hand-washing, etc. |

```
THE PUBLIC TEACHING (vv. 10-11)
    │
    ├─ The audience shift (v. 10):
    │   │
    │   └─► "Jesus called the CROWD to him and said,
    │        'LISTEN and UNDERSTAND'"
    │       │
    │       └─► Jesus pivots from Pharisees to crowd
    │           │
    │           └─► "Listen" (ἀκούω) — hear
    │               "Understand" (συνίετε) — comprehend
    │               │
    │               └─► This is important
    │                   Pay attention
    │
    └─► The principle (v. 11):
        │
        └─► "What goes INTO someone's mouth
             does NOT DEFILE them,
             but what comes OUT of a person's mouth,
             that is what DEFILES them"
            │
            └─► κοινόω (koinoō) — "to make common, defile"
                │
                └─► Revolutionary statement:
                    │
                    ├─ NOT defiled by: Food (what enters)
                    │   └─► Challenges all dietary laws
                    │       Challenges Pharisaic purity system
                    │
                    └─► Defiled by: Words (what exits)
                        │
                        └─► Defilement = INTERNAL
                            Not external contamination
                            │
                            └─► This overturns entire system:
                                │
                                └─► Pharisees obsessed with:
                                    What you touch
                                    What you eat
                                    Ritual washings
                                    │
                                    └─► Jesus: HEART is the issue
                                        Not hands, not food
```

```
DISCIPLES' CONCERN (v. 12)
    │
    └─► "Then the disciples came to him and asked,
         'Do you know that the PHARISEES WERE OFFENDED
          when they heard this?'"
        │
        └─► ἐσκανδαλίσθησαν (eskandalisthēsan)
            "Were scandalized, offended, stumbled"
            │
            └─► Disciples worried:
                │
                └─► "You just insulted religious leaders"
                    This will cause trouble
                    │
                    └─► Implying: Maybe soften message?
                        Apologize? Clarify?
```

```
JESUS' RESPONSE: TWO IMAGES (vv. 13-14)
    │
    ├─ IMAGE 1: Uprooted plants (v. 13)
    │   │
    │   └─► "Every PLANT that my heavenly Father
    │        has NOT PLANTED
    │        will be PULLED UP by the roots"
    │       │
    │       └─► Agricultural metaphor:
    │           │
    │           ├─ Father plants → survives
    │           └─► Father didn't plant → uprooted
    │               │
    │               └─► Application to Pharisees:
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Their tradition = NOT from God
    │                       Therefore will be removed
    │                       │
    │                       └─► God's word stands

**The Blind Leading Blind:**

```
PHARISEES AS GUIDES
    │
    ├─ Claim: We know the way (religious authority)
    ├─ Reality: We're blind (missing the heart)
    └─► Result: Leading followers to destruction
        │
        └─► This is why Jesus is harsh:
            │
            └─► Not just: "They're wrong"
                IS: "They're destroying others"
                │
                └─► False teaching = deadly
                    Blind guides = pit ahead
```

```
PETER'S REQUEST (v. 15)
    │
    └─► "Peter said, 'EXPLAIN THE PARABLE to us'"
        │
        └─► "The parable" = v. 11
            "What goes in doesn't defile,
             what comes out does"
            │
            └─► Peter doesn't understand
                This is too radical
                Too different from Judaism
```

```
JESUS' EXASPERATION (v. 16)
    │
    └─► "'Are you STILL SO DULL?' Jesus asked them"
        │
        └─► ἀσύνετοι (asynetoi) — "without understanding, foolish"
            │
            └─► "Still" (ἀκμήν) — even now
                After all this time

                    └─► They've been with Him
                        Seen miracles

THE EXPLANATION (vv. 17-20)
    │
    ├─ FOOD pathway (v. 17):
    │   │
    │   └─► "Don't you see that whatever ENTERS THE MOUTH
    │        goes into the STOMACH
    │        and then OUT OF THE BODY?"
    │       │
    │       └─► Simple biology:
    │           │
    │           └─► Food → stomach → latrine
    │               │
    │               └─► Mark 7:19 adds:
    │                   "(In saying this, Jesus declared
    │                    all foods clean)"
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Revolutionary:
    │                       Kosher laws = irrelevant
    │                       Dietary restrictions = not the point
    │                       │
    │                       └─► Food doesn't affect HEART
    │                           Just passes through body
    │
    ├─ HEART pathway (v. 18):
    │   │
    │   └─► "But the things that come OUT of a person's mouth
    │        come FROM THE HEART,
    │        and THESE DEFILE them"
    │       │
    │       └─► ἐκ τῆς καρδίας (ek tēs kardias) — "from the heart"
    │           │
    │           └─► Mouth speaks what heart contains

    │                   │
    │                   └─► Words reveal heart condition
    │                       Speech exposes internal state
    │
    └─► THE LIST (v. 19-20a):
        │
        └─► "For out of the HEART come:
             - EVIL THOUGHTS
             - MURDER
             - ADULTERY
             - SEXUAL IMMORALITY

             - FALSE TESTIMONY
             - SLANDER

                ├─ Theft (κλοπαί)
                │   └─► Eighth commandment

                ├─ False testimony (ψευδομαρτυρίαι)
                │   └─► Ninth commandment

                └─► Slander (βλασφημίαι)
                    └─► Evil speech against others/God
                    │
                    └─► All originate FROM HEART
                        Not from external contamination
                        │
                        └─► Heart is source
                            Heart is problem
```

**Heart vs Hands:**

```
THE CONTRAST
    │
    ├─ PHARISEES FOCUS:
    │   └─► External purity
    │       │
    │       ├─ Wash hands
    │       ├─ Avoid certain foods
    │       ├─ Follow rituals
    │       └─► Result: Clean hands, dirty heart
    │
    └─► JESUS FOCUS:
        └─► Internal purity
            │
            ├─ Evil from within (heart)
            ├─ Words reveal heart
            ├─ Deeds flow from heart
            └─► Result: Fix the heart or ritual is vain
                │
                └─► Jeremiah 17:9: "The heart is deceitful
                                     above all things
                                     and beyond cure.
                                     Who can understand it?"
```

```
CONCLUSION (v. 20b)
    │
    └─► "But eating with UNWASHED HANDS
         does NOT DEFILE them"
        │
        └─► Returns to original accusation (v. 2)
            │
            └─► Pharisees concerned: Unwashed hands
                Jesus: Irrelevant
                │
                └─► Hand-washing ≠ holiness
                    Heart condition = everything
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I focus on external religious performance while neglecting internal heart condition? Do I elevate tradition over Scripture?*

**One-line:** Jesus exposes Pharisaic hypocrisy where tradition nullifies God's command and ritual replaces heart purity—defilement comes from within, not without.

HER PERSISTENCE (v. 25)

    └─► "The woman CAME and KNELT before him.
         'Lord, HELP ME!' she said"
        │
        └─► Two actions:
            │
            ├─ CAME (ἐλθοῦσα)
            │   └─► Didn't leave

JESUS' SECOND RESPONSE (v. 26)
    │
    └─► "He replied,
         'It is NOT RIGHT to take the CHILDREN'S BREAD
          and toss it to the DOGS'"
        │
        └─► Even harsher than v. 24:
            │
            └─► The metaphor:
                │
                ├─ CHILDREN (τέκνα)
                │   └─► Jews (God's covenant people)

                ├─ BREAD (ἄρτον)

                └─► DOGS (κυναρίοις)

                                House pets

                                └─► But still: Dogs vs children
                                    Lower status
                                    │
                                    └─► Jews called Gentiles "dogs"

                                        └─► Jesus uses their language
                                            Tests her response
```

**The Test:**

```
WHY IS JESUS SO HARSH?
    │
    └─► Not: Because He's racist
        Not: Because He agrees with slur
        │
        IS: Testing her faith
            │
            └─► Will she:
                │
                ├─ Get offended and leave?
                ├─ Argue about theology?
                └─► OR accept humble position
                    But still ask for mercy?
                    │
                    └─► This is the test:
                        │
                        └─► True faith persists
                            Even through rejection
                            Even through insult
                            │
                            └─► She's about to pass
```

```
HER RESPONSE (v. 27)
    │
    └─► "'YES IT IS, LORD,' she said.
         'Even the DOGS eat the CRUMBS
          that fall from their master's table'"
        │
        └─► Ναί, κύριε — "Yes, Lord"
            │
            └─► She ACCEPTS the metaphor:
                │
                ├─ Doesn't argue: "I'm not a dog!"
                ├─ Doesn't get offended
                └─► Agrees: "Yes, I'm a dog"
                    │
                    └─► But adds brilliant twist:
                        │
                        └─► "Even DOGS eat CRUMBS
                             from master's table"
                            │
                            └─► Her logic:
                                │
                                ├─ Children get bread (main meal)
                                ├─ Dogs get crumbs (leftovers)
                                └─► I'm not asking for children's bread
                                    │
                                    └─► Just CRUMBS
                                        │
                                        └─► Your LEFTOVERS are enough
                                            Your overflow = sufficient
                                            │
                                            └─► She recognizes:
                                                │
                                                └─► Jesus' power so abundant
                                                    Even scraps heal
                                                    │
                                                    └─► Not demanding priority
                                                        Just asking for overflow
```

**Her Faith:**

```
WHAT MAKES THIS "GREAT FAITH"?
    │
    ├─ Persistence through rejection
    │   └─► Silence, "not sent," "dogs"
    │       She doesn't quit
    │
    ├─ Humility in response
    │   └─► Accepts "dog" status
    │       Doesn't demand rights
    │
    ├─ Belief in abundance
    │   └─► "Crumbs are enough"
    │       Jesus' power = so vast
    │       Even overflow heals
    │
    └─► Faith transcends ethnicity
        │
        └─► She's Canaanite (enemy)
            But has more faith than Israel
            │
            └─► This prefigures:
                │
                └─► Gospel going to Gentiles
                    When Jews reject
```

```
JESUS' COMMENDATION (v. 28)
    │
    └─► "Then Jesus said to her,
         'WOMAN, YOU HAVE GREAT FAITH!
          Your request is GRANTED.'
         And her daughter was HEALED AT THAT MOMENT"
        │
        └─► The verdict:
            │
            └─► "GREAT FAITH" (μεγάλη σου ἡ πίστις)
                │
                └─► Only TWO people in Matthew
                    Called "great faith":
                    │
                    ├─ Centurion (8:10) — Gentile
                    └─► Canaanite woman (15:28) — Gentile
                        │
                        └─► BOTH GENTILES
                            │
                            └─► Israel has "little faith"
                                Gentiles have "great faith"
                                │
                                └─► This is the IRONY
                                    Insiders lack faith
                                    Outsiders demonstrate faith
```

**The Immediate Healing:**

```
"HER DAUGHTER WAS HEALED AT THAT MOMENT"
    │
    └─► ἀπὸ τῆς ὥρας ἐκείνης
        "From that very hour"
        │
        └─► Immediate, complete healing
            │
            ├─ No touch needed
            ├─ No presence required
            └─► Faith + Jesus' word = healing
                │
                └─► Distance irrelevant
                    (Like centurion's servant, 8:13)
                    │
                    └─► Jesus' authority extends
                        Beyond physical presence
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I give up when God seems silent, or persist in faith? Do I have ethnic or cultural prejudices that limit who I think God loves?*

**One-line:** Canaanite woman's great faith persists through silence and rejection, humbly accepting "dog" status to receive crumbs—her daughter healed instantly.

**Key Greek:**
- σπλαγχνίζομαι (splanchnizomai) — "to have compassion"
- σπυρίς (spyris) — "large basket, hamper"

```
THE SETTING (vv. 29-31)
    │
    ├─ Return to Jewish territory (v. 29):
    │   │
    │   └─► "Jesus left there and went along
    │        the SEA OF GALILEE.
    │        Then he went up on a MOUNTAINSIDE
    │        and SAT DOWN"
    │       │
    │       └─► Back from Gentile region (Tyre/Sidon)
    │           To Sea of Galilee (Jewish territory)
    │           │
    │           └─► Mountain = teaching position
    │               Sitting = rabbi posture
    │
    ├─ The crowds come (v. 30a):
    │   │
    │   └─► "GREAT CROWDS came to him, bringing:
    │        - the LAME
    │        - the BLIND
    │        - the CRIPPLED
    │        - the MUTE
    │        - and MANY OTHERS,
    │        and laid them at his feet"
    │       │
    │       └─► Catalog of suffering:
    │           │
    │           └─► All types of brokenness
    │               Physical disabilities
    │               │
    │               └─► Brought TO JESUS
    │                   Laid at His feet
    │
    ├─ Jesus healed them (v. 30b):
    │   │
    │   └─► "And he HEALED THEM"
    │       │
    │       └─► ἐθεράπευσεν αὐτούς
    │           Simple statement
    │           │
    │           └─► No details
    │               Just: He healed them
    │               All of them
    │
    └─► People's response (v. 31):
        │
        └─► "The people were AMAZED when they saw:
             - the MUTE speaking
             - the CRIPPLED made well
             - the LAME walking
             - the BLIND seeing.
             And they PRAISED THE GOD OF ISRAEL"
            │
            └─► Four reversals:
                │
                ├─ Mute → speaking
                ├─ Crippled → made well
                ├─ Lame → walking
                └─► Blind → seeing
                    │
                    └─► Fulfills Isaiah 35:5-6:
                        "Then will eyes of blind be opened
                         and ears of deaf unstopped.
                         Then will lame leap like deer,
                         and mute tongue shout for joy"
                        │
                        └─► Messianic signs
                            Kingdom breaking in
                            │
                            └─► Result: Praise to "God of Israel"
                                Gentile woman just healed
                                Now Jewish crowds healed
                                │
                                └─► Jesus' compassion = universal
```

```
JESUS' COMPASSION (v. 32)
    │
    └─► "Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
         'I have COMPASSION for these people;
          they have already been with me THREE DAYS
          and have NOTHING TO EAT.
          I do not want to send them away HUNGRY,
          or they may COLLAPSE on the way'"

            └─► Same word as 14:14
                │
                └─► Jesus' heart moved:
                    │
                    ├─ THREE DAYS with Him
                    │   └─► Long time without food
                    │       They stayed for teaching/healing
                    │       Prioritized Jesus over meals
                    │
                    ├─ NOTHING TO EAT
                    │   └─► Supplies exhausted

                        └─► ἐκλυθῶσιν (eklythōsin)
                            "Faint, give out"
                            │
                            └─► Jesus doesn't want them harmed
                                Compassion = practical care
```

```
DISCIPLES' RESPONSE (v. 33)
    │
    └─► "His disciples answered,
         'Where could we get enough bread
          in this REMOTE PLACE
          to feed such a CROWD?'"
        │
        └─► Haven't they learned?
            │
            └─► Just did this in chapter 14:
                │
                ├─ 5,000 fed from 5 loaves + 2 fish
                └─► Now: Same problem
                    │
                    └─► Disciples still don't get it:
                        │
                        └─► "Where could we get bread?"
                            │
                            └─► Forgetting:
                                Jesus CREATES bread
                                Doesn't need source
                                │
                                └─► Mark 8:17-18: Jesus later asks,
                                    "Do you still not see or understand?
                                     Are your hearts hardened?
                                     Do you have eyes but fail to see?"
```

**Disciples' Dullness:**

```
WHY DON'T THEY REMEMBER?
    │
    └─► They saw Jesus feed 5,000
        Yet ask: "Where get bread?"
        │
        └─► Human tendency:
            │
            └─► Past provision ≠ present faith
                Yesterday's miracle forgotten today
                │
                └─► We're like Israel in wilderness:
                    │
                    └─► Exod 16: Manna every day
                        Yet Num 11: "We have nothing!"
                        │
                        └─► Short memory for God's faithfulness
```

```
JESUS' INVENTORY (v. 34)
    │
    └─► "'How many loaves do you have?' Jesus asked.
         'SEVEN,' they replied, 'and a few small FISH'"
        │
        └─► Compare to 14:17:
            │
            ├─ First feeding: 5 loaves + 2 fish
            └─► Second feeding: 7 loaves + few fish
                │
                └─► Slightly more this time
                    But still inadequate
                    │
                    └─► Seven = number of completeness
                        Sufficient in God's economy
```

```
THE DISTRIBUTION (vv. 35-36)
    │
    ├─ Command to sit (v. 35):
    │   │
    │   └─► "He told the crowd to SIT DOWN on the ground"
    │       │
    │       └─► Organization before miracle
    │           (Same as 14:19)
    │
    └─► The blessing (v. 36):
        │
        └─► "Then he took the seven loaves and the fish,
             and when he had GIVEN THANKS,
             he BROKE them
             and GAVE them to the disciples,
             and they in turn to the people"
            │
            └─► Same four actions as 14:19:
                │
                ├─ TOOK the loaves
                ├─ GAVE THANKS (εὐχαριστήσας)
                ├─ BROKE them
                └─► GAVE to disciples → people
                    │
                    └─► Eucharistic pattern:
                        │
                        └─► Take, bless, break, give
                            │
                            └─► Foreshadows Last Supper
                                Body broken
                                Given for many
```

```
THE RESULT (vv. 37-38)
    │
    ├─ Complete satisfaction (v. 37):
    │   │
    │   └─► "They ALL ate and were SATISFIED.
    │        Afterward the disciples picked up
    │        SEVEN BASKETFULS of broken pieces
    │        that were left over"
    │       │
    │       └─► Everyone fed (πάντες)
    │           Everyone satisfied (ἐχορτάσθησαν)
    │           │
    │           └─► SEVEN baskets left
    │               │
    │               └─► σπυρίς (spyris) — large hamper
    │                   │
    │                   └─► Different word than 14:20
    │                       │
    │                       ├─ First feeding: κόφινος (small basket)
    │                       │                 12 baskets
    │                       │
    │                       └─► Second feeding: σπυρίς (large hamper)
    │                                          7 baskets
    │                           │
    │                           └─► Perhaps more total volume
    │                               Despite fewer containers
    │
    └─► The count (v. 38):
        │
        └─► "The number of those who ate was
             FOUR THOUSAND MEN,
             besides women and children"
            │
            └─► Compare to 14:21:
                │
                ├─ First: 5,000 men (+ women/children)
                └─► Second: 4,000 men (+ women/children)
                    │
                    └─► Smaller crowd
                        But same principle:
                        │
                        └─► Jesus provides abundantly
                            From inadequate resources
```

**Two Feedings Compared:**

| Element | Feeding 5,000 (Ch 14) | Feeding 4,000 (Ch 15) |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Location** | Jewish territory | Jewish territory (after Gentile visit) |
| **Starting** | 5 loaves + 2 fish | 7 loaves + few fish |
| **Fed** | 5,000 men (+) | 4,000 men (+) |
| **Leftovers** | 12 baskets (κόφινος) | 7 hampers (σπυρίς) |
| **Pattern** | Take, bless, break, give | Take, thanks, break, give |

```
THE DISMISSAL (v. 39)
    │
    └─► "After Jesus had sent the crowd away,
         he got into the boat
         and went to the vicinity of MAGADAN"
        │
        └─► Magadan = uncertain location
            Possibly Magdala (Mary Magdalene's home)
            Western shore of Galilee
            │
            └─► Jesus moves on
                Ministry continues
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I remember past provisions when facing present needs? Do I bring inadequacy to Jesus expecting Him to multiply?*

**One-line:** Jesus feeds 4,000 from seven loaves after three days of teaching and healing, again demonstrating abundant provision from inadequate resources.

---

## Unified Framework

```
MATTHEW 15: HEART, FAITH, PROVISION
    │
    ├─ TRADITION vs COMMAND (vv. 1-20)
    │   ├─ Pharisees accuse: Hand-washing tradition broken
    │   ├─ Jesus accuses: God's command nullified (Corban)
    │   ├─ Heart condition > external ritual
    │   └─► What defiles = from within (heart)
    │       Not from without (food)
    │
    ├─ ETHNICITY vs FAITH (vv. 21-28)
    │   ├─ Canaanite woman begs for daughter
    │   ├─ Jesus tests with silence, rejection
    │   ├─ Woman persists: "Crumbs are enough"
    │   └─► "Great faith!" — Gentile believes
    │       Daughter healed instantly
    │
    └─ COMPASSION DEMONSTRATED (vv. 29-39)
        ├─ Crowds healed (mute, lame, blind, crippled)
        ├─ Jesus has compassion (three days, no food)
        ├─ 7 loaves + fish → 4,000 fed
        └─► 7 hampers left over
            Abundant provision, again
```

---

## Diagnostic Summary

| Section | Core Question |
|---------|---------------|
| Tradition | Do I prioritize religious ritual over heart transformation? |
| Faith | Do I persist in faith when God seems silent or rejecting? |
| Provision | Do I remember God's past faithfulness in present need? |

---

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Matthew 15:** Jesus exposes religious hypocrisy where tradition nullifies God's command and external ritual replaces internal purity, then demonstrates that faith transcends ethnic boundaries as a Canaanite woman's persistence earns commendation while Jewish crowds receive compassionate provision for the second time—heart condition and faith response matter more than heritage or ritual.

---

## Cross-References

- Isaiah 29:13 — Lips honor but hearts far (Jesus quotes re: Pharisees)
- Isaiah 35:5-6 — Blind see, lame walk (Messianic signs fulfilled)
- Exodus 20:12 — Honor father and mother (command vs Corban)
- Mark 7:1-37 — Parallel account with additional details
- Romans 2:28-29 — True Jew is inward, not outward
- Romans 10:12 — No distinction Jew/Greek for those who believe
- Galatians 3:28 — Neither Jew nor Greek in Christ
- Acts 10 — Peter's vision: No unclean food, Gentiles accepted
- Matthew 8:5-13 — Centurion's great faith (also Gentile)
- Matthew 28:19 — Great Commission: All nations

---

## Personal Notes

### The Corban Scandal

vv. 5-6 — This is infuriating.

```
THE ABUSE:
    │
    ├─ God commands: Honor parents (care for them)
    ├─ Tradition allows: Declare money "Corban" (devoted to God)
    └─► Result: Keep money, avoid helping parents
        │
        └─► Religious language = financial selfishness
            "It's God's money" = excuse for greed
```

Jesus calls this exactly what it is: **Nullifying God's word for tradition.**

The pattern I see:

```
USING "PIETY" TO AVOID OBEDIENCE
    │
    └─► Modern versions:
        │
        ├─ "I'm too busy serving at church to help family"
        ├─ "Tithing to church means I can't help neighbor"
        └─► "My ministry calling exempts me from hard relationships"
            │
            └─► Same game:
                Religious activity masks disobedience
                Spiritual language justifies selfishness
```

**v. 8:** "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."

That's me more than I want to admit.

**Application:** Stop using religious activity as excuse to avoid clear commands. God wants obedience, not sacrifice (1 Sam 15:22).

### What Actually Defiles

vv. 10-20 — This overturns everything.

"What goes into mouth doesn't defile, what comes out does."

```
JESUS' REVOLUTION:
    │
    └─► Pharisees focused on:
        │
        ├─ What you touch (ritual purity)
        ├─ What you eat (kosher laws)
        └─► External cleanliness
            │
            BUT:
            │
            └─► Jesus: Heart is the problem
                │
                └─► v. 19: "Out of the heart come:
                           - evil thoughts
                           - murder
                           - adultery
                           - sexual immorality
                           - theft
                           - false testimony
                           - slander"
                    │
                    └─► HEART produces sin
                        Not external contamination
```

**The implication:** I can't clean myself from outside.

```
MY TENDENCY:
    │
    └─► Fix external behavior
        │
        ├─ Stop doing X
        ├─ Start doing Y
        └─► Manage appearance
            │
            BUT:
            │
            └─► Heart remains unchanged
                │
                └─► Whitewashed tomb (23:27)
                    Clean outside
                    Dead inside
```

**Ezekiel 36:26:** "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh."

Only GOD can change heart.

**Application:** Stop focusing on external religious performance. Ask God to transform heart. Behavior flows from heart, not vice versa.

### The Canaanite Woman Wrecks Me

vv. 21-28 — This woman's faith is staggering.

```
HER OBSTACLES:
    │
    ├─ She's Canaanite (ancient enemy)
    ├─ She's woman (low status)
    ├─ Jesus is silent (v. 23)
    ├─ Jesus says "not sent to you" (v. 24)
    └─► Jesus calls her "dog" (v. 26)
        │
        └─► FIVE barriers
            Yet she persists
```

**v. 27:** "Yes, Lord... even the dogs eat the crumbs."

She:
- Accepts "dog" status (humility)
- Doesn't argue theology
- Believes crumbs are enough (faith in abundance)

**v. 28:** "Woman, you have GREAT FAITH!"

```
WHAT I LEARN:
    │
    └─► Great faith persists through:
        │
        ├─ Silence (when God doesn't answer)
        ├─ Rejection (when God says "no")
        └─► Humility (accepting low status)
            │
            └─► She didn't demand rights
                She begged for mercy
                │
                └─► That's faith
```

**My problem:** I give up when God is silent.

When prayers aren't answered → I assume God doesn't care.

This woman teaches: Keep asking. Keep knocking. Don't quit.

**Application:** Persist in prayer even through silence. Faith keeps crying out.

### The Irony of Great Faith

Only TWO people called "great faith" in Matthew:
1. Centurion (8:10) — Gentile
2. Canaanite woman (15:28) — Gentile

**Both OUTSIDERS.**

```
THE REVERSAL:
    │
    ├─ Israel (insiders) → little faith
    └─► Gentiles (outsiders) → great faith
        │
        └─► This prefigures:
            │
            └─► Gospel rejected by Jews
                Embraced by Gentiles
                (Acts 13:46, 28:28)
```

**Romans 9:30-32:** "Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it... but Israel, who pursued the law... did not attain it. Why? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works."

**The warning:** Proximity to truth ≠ faith.

```
I CAN:
    │
    ├─ Know theology
    ├─ Attend church
    ├─ Quote Scripture
    └─► Yet lack faith
        │
        └─► While someone "outside"
            With less knowledge
            But desperate need
            │
            └─► Has GREAT faith
```

**Application:** Don't confuse religious knowledge with living faith. Faith = trust in Jesus' abundance, even for "crumbs."

### Feeding 4,000: Disciples STILL Don't Get It

v. 33 — "Where could we get enough bread?"

ARE YOU KIDDING?

Just fed 5,000 (ch 14). Now same question.

```
DISCIPLES' PROBLEM:
    │
    └─► Saw miracle
        But didn't internalize lesson
        │
        └─► Past provision ≠ present faith
            │
            └─► They forgot:
                Jesus creates from nothing
                Inadequate resources = His specialty
```

**I'm the same.**

God provides in past → I'm grateful.

Same need arises → I panic.

**Psalm 78:10-11:** "They did not keep God's covenant... they forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them."

**Application:** Remember past faithfulness. God who provided before will provide again.

### The Pattern Repeated

Two feedings:
- 5,000 from 5 loaves
- 4,000 from 7 loaves

**Why repeat?**

```
JESUS TEACHING:
    │
    └─► This is WHO I AM
        Not one-time event
        │
        └─► I provide abundantly
            From inadequate resources
            Repeatedly
            │
            └─► This is My nature
                This is what I do
```

Both times:
- Compassion for hungry crowds
- Inadequate starting resources
- Blessing, breaking, giving
- Everyone satisfied
- Leftovers abundant

**The principle:**

```
BRING WHAT YOU HAVE
    │
    └─► However small
        │
        └─► Jesus multiplies
            │
            └─► Abundantly
                │
                └─► Every time
```

**2 Corinthians 9:8:** "God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work."

**Application:** Stop hoarding inadequacy. Bring it to Jesus. He multiplies what's given, not what's kept.

---

### Summary Thoughts

Three major themes collide in this chapter:

**1. Heart > Ritual**

Pharisees obsessed with external purity.

Jesus: Heart is the issue.

```
NO AMOUNT OF:
    │
    ├─ Hand-washing
    ├─ Dietary laws
    └─► Religious performance
        │
        CAN FIX:
        │
        └─► Corrupt heart
            │
            └─► Need new heart (Ezek 36:26)
                Only God can give
```

**2. Faith > Ethnicity**

Canaanite woman (outsider) has great faith.

Pharisees (insiders) have vain worship.

```
GOD DOESN'T LOOK AT:
    │
    ├─ Your lineage
    ├─ Your heritage
    └─► Your religious credentials
        │
        GOD LOOKS AT:
        │
        └─► Heart
            Faith
            │
            └─► Galatians 3:26: "You are all
                                  children of God
                                  through FAITH in Christ Jesus"
```

**3. Provision > Scarcity**

Jesus feeds thousands. Twice.

From almost nothing.

```

    └─► God's economy ≠ scarcity
        │
        └─► 5 loaves → 5,000 fed
            7 loaves → 4,000 fed
            │
            └─► Leftovers every time
                │
                └─► God provides ABUNDANTLY
                    From inadequate resources
                    │
                    └─► Bring what you have
                        He multiplies
```

**The call:**

- Fix heart, not just behavior (vv. 1-20)
- Persist in faith, even through rejection (vv. 21-28)
- Trust provision, remembering past faithfulness (vv. 29-39)

**v. 28:** "Woman, you have great faith!"

That's what I want Jesus to say about me.

Not: "You have great theology."
Not: "You followed all rituals."

"You have great FAITH."

Faith that persists.
Faith that humbles.
Faith that believes crumbs are enough.

That's the faith that gets commended.

That's the faith I need.
