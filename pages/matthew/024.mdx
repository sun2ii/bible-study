## The Five Movements

| Section | Focus | Core Principle |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Trigger** (vv. 1-3) | Temple destruction prophecy | Disciples ask "when?" and "what sign?" |
| **Birth Pains** (vv. 4-14) | Preliminary signs | Deception, wars, persecution—but not yet the end |
| **Tribulation** (vv. 15-28) | Great distress | Flee when you see abomination; false messiahs |
| **Coming** (vv. 29-35) | Son of Man appears | Cosmic signs, gathering elect, fig tree lesson |
| **Readiness** (vv. 36-51) | Unknown timing | Watch, be ready, faithful service |

## Conceptual Flow

```
MATTHEW 24 STRUCTURE
    │
    ├─ vv. 1-3    THE TRIGGER
    │   ├─► Temple admired by disciples
    │   ├─► Jesus: "Not one stone on another"
    │   └─► Disciples' TWO questions:
    │       ├─ (1) WHEN will this happen?
    │       └─ (2) What SIGN of coming/end?
    │
    ├─ vv. 4-14   BIRTH PAINS (Beginning of Sorrows)
    │   ├─► False messiahs deceive many
    │   ├─► Wars and rumors of wars
    │   ├─► Nation vs nation, kingdom vs kingdom
    │   ├─► Famines, earthquakes
    │   ├─► Persecution, hatred, martyrdom
    │   ├─► Apostasy, betrayal, false prophets
    │   ├─► Love grows cold
    │   ├─► "He who endures to end = saved"
    │   └─► Gospel preached to all nations → THEN the end
    │
    ├─ vv. 15-28  THE GREAT TRIBULATION
    │   ├─► "Abomination of desolation" in holy place
    │   ├─► FLEE to mountains immediately
    │   ├─► Great distress—unequaled ever
    │   ├─► Days shortened for elect's sake
    │   ├─► False messiahs with signs/wonders
    │   └─► Coming = like LIGHTNING (unmistakable)
    │       "Where carcass is, vultures gather"
    │
    ├─ vv. 29-35  THE COMING
    │   ├─► "Immediately after tribulation..."
    │   │   ├─ Sun darkened
    │   │   ├─ Moon no light
    │   │   ├─ Stars fall
    │   │   └─ Powers shaken
    │   ├─► Sign of Son of Man appears
    │   ├─► All tribes mourn
    │   ├─► Son of Man on clouds with power/glory
    │   ├─► Angels gather elect from four winds
    │   ├─► FIG TREE: Tender branches = summer near
    │   └─► "This generation will not pass away"
    │       "Heaven/earth pass, my words remain"
    │
    └─ vv. 36-51  THE READINESS IMPERATIVE
        ├─► "That day/hour NO ONE KNOWS"
        │   Not angels, not Son—only Father
        ├─► Like DAYS OF NOAH
        │   Normal life → sudden destruction
        ├─► Two in field: one taken, one left
        ├─► KEEP WATCH—you don't know when
        ├─► Thief in night metaphor
        └─► FAITHFUL vs WICKED servant
            ├─ Faithful: found working → rewarded
            └─ Wicked: "Master delayed" → judged
                → Cut to pieces with hypocrites
```

## The Olivet Discourse Architecture

```
SETTING:
    │
    └─► Leaving TEMPLE (v. 1)
        │
        Jesus has just:
        │
        ├─ Silenced opponents (ch 22)
        ├─ Pronounced seven woes (ch 23)
        └─► Lamented: "House left desolate" (23:38)
            │
            NOW: Disciples point to temple buildings
            │
            → Magnificent Herodian construction
              Started 20 BC
              Still ongoing (46 years - John 2:20)
              │
              Massive stones (some 40+ feet long)
              Gold adornment
              "Whoever has not seen it
               has not seen a beautiful building"
               (Babylonian Talmud)

THE PROPHECY (v. 2):
    │
    └─► "Not one stone on another"
        │
        → Absolute certainty
          Total destruction
          │
          FULFILLED: AD 70
          │
          Titus destroys Jerusalem
          Temple burned
          Soldiers pried stones for gold
          that melted into cracks

THE LOCATION (v. 3):
    │
    └─► "Mount of Olives"
        │
        Across Kidron Valley
        Overlooks Temple Mount
        │
        → PRIVATE setting
          │
          Only disciples present
          Eschatological instruction
```

```
THE TWO-PART QUESTION (v. 3):
    │
    └─► "Tell us:
         (1) WHEN will this happen?
         (2) What will be the SIGN of your coming
             and of the end of the age?"
        │
        └─► QUESTION 1: WHEN?
            │
            → Temple destruction
              The "not one stone" event
            │
            QUESTION 2: WHAT SIGN?
            │
            Two key terms:
            │
            ├─ "PAROUSIA" (coming)
            │   │
            │   Technical term in ancient world:
            │   Royal visit, official arrival of a king
            │   │
            │   Used 4x in Matt 24 (vv. 3, 27, 37, 39)
            │   │
            │   → Messiah's arrival in power
            │     Visible, public manifestation
            │
            └─► "END of the AGE"
                │
                → End of present age
                  Beginning of age to come
                  │
                  Jewish two-age theology:
                  │
                  ├─ "This age" — Present evil age
                  └─► "The age to come" — Messianic age

DISCIPLES' LIKELY ASSUMPTION:
    │
    └─► Temple destruction
        = Coming of Messiah
        = End of age
        │
        ALL SIMULTANEOUS
        │
        → Jesus will distinguish
          Near from far
          Partial from complete
```

---

## The Interpretive Framework

```
THREE MAIN VIEWS:
    │
    ├─ PRETERIST (Past)
    │   │
    │   └─► Most/all fulfilled in AD 70
    │       │
    │       ├─ "This generation" = literal 40 years
    │       ├─ Temple destruction = primary referent
    │       └─► Coming = judgment on Jerusalem
    │           (Not literal second coming)
    │       │
    │       STRENGTH: Takes "this generation" literally
    │       WEAKNESS: Cosmic signs seem beyond AD 70
    │
    ├─ FUTURIST (Future)
    │   │
    │   └─► Most refers to end times
    │       │
    │       ├─ "This generation" = generation alive at end
    │       │   (Or: "race" - generation as ethnic group)
    │       ├─ Temple = future rebuilt temple
    │       └─► Signs = literal cosmic events
    │       │
    │       STRENGTH: Takes cosmic signs literally
    │       WEAKNESS: Strains "this generation"
    │
    └─► ALREADY/NOT YET (Both)
        │
        └─► Prophetic telescoping
            │
            Near AND far fulfillments
            │
            ├─ AD 70 = partial/typological
            └─► Second Coming = full/final
                │
                PATTERN:
                │
                vv. 4-14: General signs (ongoing)
                vv. 15-22: AD 70 focus
                vv. 23-28: Transition
                vv. 29-31: Second Coming
                vv. 32-35: Both referents
                vv. 36-51: Unknown timing (Second Coming)
                │
                → "This generation" sees AD 70
                   Final generation sees rest

PROPHETIC TELESCOPING:
    │
    └─► Old Testament prophets often:
        │
        ├─ Saw two mountain peaks
        │   Without seeing valley between
        │
        ├─ Exile + Messiah's coming
        │   Often in same breath
        │
        └─► Near judgment + final judgment
            Blended in single oracle
            │
            → Jesus may do same:
              │
              AD 70 ←→ Second Coming
              │
              Near event = type of final
              Pattern repeats at greater scale
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. Temple Destruction Predicted (vv. 1-2)

```
THE ADMIRATION (v. 1)
    │
    └─► "Jesus left the temple and was walking away
         when his disciples came up to him
         to call his attention to its BUILDINGS"
        │
        └─► Disciples impressed
            Massive construction
            │
            Josephus (Jewish War 5.5.6):
            │
            "The temple appeared from a distance
             like a mountain covered with snow,
             for where it was not covered with gold
             it was exceeding white"
            │
            Some stones: 67 x 7.5 x 9 feet
            │
            → Pride of Judaism
              National identity
              God's dwelling

THE PROPHECY (v. 2)
    │
    └─► "Do you see all these things?" he asked.
         "Truly I tell you,
         not one stone here will be left on another;
         every one will be thrown down"
        │
        └─► "Truly I say to you"
            │
            → Solemn introduction
              Authoritative declaration
              │
              Strong double negative in Greek
              │
              "Definitely will not be left"
              │
              → Absolute certainty
                Total destruction
                │
                FULFILLED: AD 70
                │
                Titus's armies
                Temple burned (despite orders)
                Soldiers pried stones for gold
                │
                → Prophecy literally fulfilled
                  40 years later
```

---

### 2. The Disciples' Question (v. 3)

```
THE SETTING (v. 3a)
    │
    └─► "As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives,
         the disciples came to him PRIVATELY"
        │
        └─► Teaching posture
            Rabbinic position
            │
            Overlooks Temple
            Prophetic location
            │
            Zech 14:4: "On that day his feet
                        will stand on Mount of Olives"
            │
            → Eschatological significance

THE QUESTION (v. 3b)
    │
    └─► "Tell us:
         WHEN will this happen,
         and WHAT will be the SIGN
         of your coming and of the end of the age?"
        │
        └─► THREE ELEMENTS:
            │
            ├─ WHEN?
            │   └─► Temple destruction (v. 2)
            │       → Timing question
            │
            ├─ SIGN?
            │   └─► Singular: One definitive sign?
            │       Or: Signs as category?
            │
            └─► TWO EVENTS:
                │
                ├─ "Your COMING" (parousia)
                │   │
                │   Technical term in ancient world:
                │   Royal visit, official arrival
                │   │
                │   → Messiah's arrival in power
                │     Visible, public manifestation
                │
                └─► "END of the AGE"
                    │
                    → End of present age
                      Beginning of age to come

DISCIPLES' LIKELY ASSUMPTION:
    │
    └─► Temple destruction
        = Coming of Messiah
        = End of age
        │
        ALL SIMULTANEOUS
        │
        → Jesus will distinguish
          Near from far
          Partial from complete
```

---

### 3. Birth Pains (vv. 4-14)

```
THE PRIMARY WARNING (vv. 4-5)
    │
    └─► "Watch out that no one DECEIVES you.
         For many will come in my name,
         claiming, 'I am the Messiah,'
         and will deceive many"
        │
        └─► FIRST concern: DECEPTION
            │
            "Many will come in MY NAME"
            │
            ├─ Claiming his authority
            └─► Saying "I am the Christ"
                │
                → False messiahs
                  Historical examples:
                  │
                  ├─ Theudas (Acts 5:36) ~AD 45
                  ├─ Egyptian (Acts 21:38) ~AD 54
                  ├─ Simon bar Kokhba ~AD 132
                  └─► Many others through history

WARS AND RUMORS (vv. 6-7)
    │
    └─► "You will hear of WARS and rumors of wars,
         but see to it that you are not ALARMED.
         Such things must happen,
         but the end is still to come.

         Nation will rise against nation,
         and kingdom against kingdom.
         There will be FAMINES and EARTHQUAKES
         in various places"
        │
        └─► TWO CATEGORIES:
            │
            ├─ POLITICAL chaos
            │   │
            │   ├─ Wars
            │   ├─ Rumors of wars
            │   ├─ Nation against nation
            │   └─► Kingdom against kingdom
            │       │
            │       → International conflict
            │         Civil wars
            │         Imperial upheaval
            │
            └─► NATURAL disasters
                │
                ├─ Famines
                └─► Earthquakes
                    │
                    → Cosmic disruption
                      Creation groaning (Rom 8:22)

            KEY CAUTION:
            │
            └─► "Do not be ALARMED"
                │
                → Don't panic
                  Don't assume the end
                  │
                  "For it MUST happen"
                  │
                  Divine necessity
                  Part of the plan
                  │
                  "But the end is NOT YET"
                  │
                  → These are SIGNS
                    Not THE end

THE METAPHOR (v. 8)
    │
    └─► "All these are the BEGINNING of birth pains"
        │
        └─► "Birth pains" — KEY TERM
            │
            OT background:
            │
            ├─ Isa 13:8: "Pangs and agony will grip them...
            │              like a woman in labor"
            ├─ Jer 4:31: "I hear a cry as of a woman in labor"
            ├─ Hos 13:13: "Pains as of a woman in childbirth"
            └─► Micah 4:9-10: "Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion,
                               like a woman in labor"
            │
            → Jewish concept: "Birth pangs of Messiah"
              │
              Suffering BEFORE Messianic age
              │
              SIGNIFICANCE:
              │
              ├─ Birth pains INCREASE
              │   └─► Not constant—escalating
              │
              ├─ Birth pains have PURPOSE

            │       Problem: What about cosmic signs?
            │       Solution: AD 70 = typological
            │                 Cosmic = symbolic

                      Near shadows far
                      Partial precedes complete

            THE ANCHOR (v. 35):
            │
            "Heaven and earth will pass away"
            │
            → Even the cosmos is temporary

              "But my words will certainly not pass away"
              │
              → Christ's words MORE permanent
                Than physical universe
                │
                → Authority claim:

THE IMPERATIVE (vv. 42-44)
    │
    └─► "Therefore KEEP WATCH,
         because you do not know

         If the owner of the house had known
         at what time of night the THIEF was coming,
         he would have kept watch
         and would not have let his house be broken into.

### 8. The Faithful Servant (vv. 45-51)

```
THE QUESTION (v. 45)
    │
    └─► "Who then is the FAITHFUL and WISE servant,
         whom the master has put in charge
         of the servants in his household
         to give them their food at the proper time?"
        │
        └─► "Who is the faithful and wise servant?"
            │
            TWO QUALITIES:
            │
            ├─ FAITHFUL
            │   └─► Trustworthy
            │       Reliable
            │       Does what assigned
            │
            └─► WISE
                └─► Prudent
                    Discerning
                    Knows what to do
                │
                → Character + competence

            THE ROLE:
            │
            "Whom the master has set
             over his household"
            │
            → Position of authority
              Stewardship
              Not owner, but manager
              │
              "To give them food
               at the proper time"
              │
              → FUNCTION: Provide for others
                Care for those under you
                Right time, right provision

THE FAITHFUL SERVANT (vv. 46-47)
    │
    └─► "It will be GOOD for that servant
         whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
         Truly I tell you, he will put him
         in charge of ALL his possessions"
        │
        └─► "Blessed is that servant"
            │
            → Beatitude form
              Same word: Beatitudes (5:3-11)
              │
              "Whom his master coming
               finds doing thus"
              │
              → FOUND doing the job
                At master's return
                Not: Completed task
                IS: In process of obedience
                │
                Faithful = doing when found

            THE REWARD:
            │
            └─► "Over all his possessions
                 he will set him"
                │
                → PROMOTION
                  From household manager
                  To manager of EVERYTHING
                  │
                  → Faithfulness in small
                    = Authority over great
                    │
                    Matt 25:21: "Faithful over few,
                                 I will put you over much"

THE WICKED SERVANT (vv. 48-51)
    │
    └─► "But suppose that servant is WICKED
         and says to himself,
         'My master is staying away a long time,'
         and he then begins to BEAT his fellow servants
         and to eat and drink with drunkards.

         The master of that servant will come
         on a day when he does not expect him
         and at an hour he is not aware of.
         He will CUT HIM TO PIECES
         and assign him a place with the HYPOCRITES,
         where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth"
        │
        └─► THE WICKEDNESS:
            │
            "But if that wicked servant says
             in his heart"
            │
            → Internal reasoning
              Heart decision
              │
              "My master DELAYS"
              │
              → Presumption on delay
                → Changes behavior
                │
                TWO SINS:
                │
                ├─ "Beat his fellow servants"
                │   │
                │   → Abuse of authority
                │     Violence toward equals
                │
                └─► "Eat and drink with drunkards"
                    │
                    → Self-indulgence
                      Wrong company
                      Abandoning duty

            THE JUDGMENT:
            │
            ├─ TIMING:
            │   │
            │   "The master will come
            │    on day he doesn't expect
            │    and hour he doesn't know"
            │   │
            │   → Catches him in sin
            │     No time to prepare
            │
            └─► PUNISHMENT:
                │
                "Will CUT HIM IN TWO"
                │
                → Severe judgment
                  │
                  ├─ Literal? Gruesome execution
                  └─► Figurative? Total destruction
                      Separation from master
                │
                "His portion with the HYPOCRITES"
                │
                → "Hypocrites"
                  │
                  Same word: Chapter 23 (7 woes)
                  │
                  → Servant CLAIMED to serve
                    But didn't
                    = Hypocrite
                    │
                    "There will be weeping
                     and gnashing of teeth"
                    │
                    → Standard judgment formula
                      Matt 8:12; 13:42,50; 22:13; 25:30
                      │
                      → Grief + rage
                        Loss + frustration

## Unified Framework

```
MATTHEW 24 ARCHITECTURE:
    │
    ├─ TRIGGER (vv. 1-3)
    │   │
    │   └─► Temple destruction predicted
    │       │
    │       Disciples ask:
    │       ├─ WHEN = temple fall?
    │       └─► WHAT SIGN = coming/end?
    │
    ├─ BIRTH PAINS (vv. 4-14)
    │   │
    │   └─► Signs that are NOT the end:
    │       │
    │       ├─ False messiahs
    │       ├─ Wars and rumors
    │       ├─ Nation vs nation

    ├─ TRIBULATION (vv. 15-28)
    │   │
    │   └─► The great distress:
    │       │
    │       ├─ Abomination in holy place
    │       ├─ Urgent flight needed
    │       ├─ Unequaled suffering
    │       ├─ Days shortened for elect
    │       ├─ False signs and wonders
    │       └─► Coming = obvious as lightning
    │
    ├─ COMING (vv. 29-35)
    │   │
    │   └─► The Son of Man appears:
    │       │
    │       ├─ Cosmic signs
    │       ├─ Sign of Son of Man
    │       ├─ All tribes mourn

    │       ├─ Angels gather elect
    │       ├─ Fig tree lesson: "near"
    │       └─► "This generation" / Words endure
    │
    └─► READINESS (vv. 36-51)
        │
        └─► The unknown timing demands:
            │
            ├─ No one knows day/hour
            ├─ Like Noah's days
            ├─ Sudden separation
            ├─ WATCH—don't know when
            ├─ Be READY—unexpected hour
            └─► Faithful servant REWARDED
                Wicked servant JUDGED
```

## Diagnostic Summary

```
THE SINGLE THREAD: READINESS
    │
    └─► Why?
        │
        ├─ Signs will occur
        │   But don't indicate exact timing
        │
        ├─ Deception will increase
        │   False messiahs, prophets, signs
        │
        ├─ Persecution will intensify
        │   Love grows cold
        │
        ├─ Suddenness guaranteed
        │   Like lightning, like thief
        │
        └─► Ignorance of timing absolute
            Not angels, not Son
            Only Father knows
            │
            THEREFORE:
            │
            └─► Constant readiness required
                │
                ├─ WATCH
                │   └─► Stay alert
                │       Don't sleep
                │
                └─► BE READY
                    └─► Not: Prepare when see
                        IS: Already prepared

THE SERVANT TEST:
    │
    └─► How do you live during "delay"?
        │
        ├─ FAITHFUL servant:
        │   │
        │   └─► "Master may return anytime"
        │       │
        │       ├─ Continues assigned work
        │       ├─ Cares for fellow servants
        │       ├─ Ready whenever
        │       └─► FOUND DOING when master comes
        │           │
        │           → REWARD: Greater authority
        │
        └─► WICKED servant:
            │
            └─► "Master delays"
                │
                ├─ Abuses fellow servants
                ├─ Self-indulges
                ├─ Neglects duty
                └─► CAUGHT sinning when master comes
                    │
                    → JUDGMENT: With hypocrites

THE PARADOX:
    │
    └─► SIGNS given (vv. 4-31)
        │
        ├─ So you know season
        │   "Summer is near"
        │   "At the door"
        │
        BUT:
        │
        └─► DAY/HOUR unknown (vv. 36-51)
            │
            ├─ So you can't relax
            │   "When you don't expect"
            │   "Hour you don't know"
            │
            → Know the SEASON
              Don't know the MOMENT
              │
              → Live ready ALWAYS
```

```
WHAT READINESS LOOKS LIKE:
    │
    ├─ NOT: Date-setting
    │   └─► v. 36 forbids this
    │       No one knows
    │
    ├─ NOT: Panic at signs
    │   └─► v. 6: "Don't be alarmed"
    │       Signs ≠ immediate end
    │
    ├─ NOT: Abandoning normal life
    │   └─► Noah's generation was wrong
    │       For ignoring, not for living
    │
    └─► IS: Faithful service
        │
        ├─ Do assigned work
        │   "Give food at proper time"
        │
        ├─ Care for others
        │   "Fellow servants"
        │
        ├─ Stay alert
        │   "Watch"
        │
        └─► Maintain urgency
            "Be ready"
            │
            → Readiness = faithful living
              Not: Watching sky
              IS: Serving well
```

## Chapter in One Sentence

**When disciples ask about the temple's destruction and signs of his coming, Jesus describes birth-pains of false messiahs, wars, and persecution that are not yet the end, warns of the great tribulation requiring urgent flight when the abomination appears, promises his return will be unmistakable as lightning with cosmic signs and angelic gathering of the elect, then emphasizes that since no one knows the day or hour—not angels, not even the Son—constant watchfulness and faithful service are required, for the master will return unexpectedly to reward faithful servants and condemn those who presumed on delay.**

## Personal Notes

### The Two Questions Problem

```
THE DISCIPLES ASK (v. 3):
    │
    ├─ (1) WHEN will temple fall?
    └─ (2) WHAT SIGN of coming/end?
        │
        → They assume: ONE EVENT
          Temple fall = Coming = End
          │
          Jesus' answer distinguishes:
          │
          ├─ Near: AD 70 (Temple)
          └─ Far: Second Coming

WHY THE CONFUSION?
    │
    └─► Prophetic telescoping
        │
        ├─ Two mountains seen
        │   Valley between hidden
        │
        ├─ Pattern repeats at larger scale
        │   AD 70 = type of end
        │   End = antitype of AD 70
        │
        └─► "This generation" sees PATTERN
            Future generation sees COMPLETION

PRACTICAL RESULT:
    │
    └─► AD 70 Christians could flee
        (They did—Pella)
        │
        Future Christians will recognize
        Final fulfillment
        │
        → Both readings valid
          Both practically useful
```

### Birth Pains Logic

```
WHY "BIRTH PAINS"?
    │
    └─► Jewish concept: "Birth pangs of Messiah"
        │
        Suffering BEFORE Messianic age arrives
        │
        CHARACTERISTICS:
        │
        ├─ They INCREASE
        │   └─► Not steady state
        │       Intensify toward climax
        │
        ├─ They have PURPOSE
        │   └─► Not random suffering
        │       Leading to new birth
        │       New creation coming
        │
        ├─ They are TEMPORARY
        │   └─► Not the destination
        │       Transition phase
        │       Will end
        │
        └─► They indicate NEARNESS
            └─► More intense = closer
                When strongest = delivery soon

APPLICATION:
    │
    └─► Don't panic at pains
        Don't despair at increasing
        │
        → They MEAN something
          Leading SOMEWHERE
          New age being born
```

### The Lightning Principle

```
FALSE COMING:
    │
    ├─ "In the wilderness" — Hidden, secretive
    └─ "In inner rooms" — Private, exclusive
        │
        → DON'T FOLLOW THESE
          All deception

TRUE COMING:
    │
    └─► "Like LIGHTNING"
        │
        ├─ From EAST to WEST
        │   └─► Horizon to horizon
        │       Total visibility
        │
        └─► CHARACTERISTICS:
            │
            ├─ VISIBLE to all
            │   └─► No one can miss it
            │
            ├─ SUDDEN
            │   └─► Instant appearance
            │
            ├─ UNMISTAKABLE
            │   └─► No doubt it happened
            │
            └─► UNLOCALIZED
                └─► Not "here" or "there"
                    Everywhere at once

IMPLICATION:
    │
    └─► If someone says
        "Come see Christ HERE"
        │
        → IT'S NOT HIM
          │
          When He comes:
          You won't need to be told
          You won't need to go somewhere
          You'll KNOW
```

### The Servant Contrast

```
TWO SERVANTS, SAME POSITION:
    │
    ├─ Both: Slave
    ├─ Both: Put in charge of household
    ├─ Both: Same master
    ├─ Both: Master goes away
    └─ Both: Master returns
        │
        DIFFERENCE:
        │
        └─► What they do DURING absence

FAITHFUL:
    │
    └─► "Master may return anytime"
        │
        ├─ Continues assigned work
        │   "Gives food at proper time"
        │
        ├─ Cares for others
        │   "Fellow servants"
        │
        └─► FOUND DOING when master comes
            │
            → REWARD:
              Put in charge of ALL possessions

WICKED:
    │
    └─► "Master DELAYS"
        │
        ├─ Abuses authority
        │   "Beats fellow servants"
        │
        ├─ Self-indulges
        │   "Eats/drinks with drunkards"
        │
        └─► CAUGHT sinning when master comes
            │
            → JUDGMENT:
              Cut in pieces
              Place with hypocrites

THE HINGE:
    │
    └─► "Master delays"
        │
        This thought CHANGES behavior
        │
        ├─ If coming SOON → stay faithful
        └─► If coming DELAYED → can indulge
            │
            IRONY:
            │
            → Master comes when NOT expected
              The "delay" was deception
              │
              2 Pet 3:9:
              "Lord is not slow...
               patient toward you"
              │
              → Perceived delay ≠ actual delay
                It's patience, not slowness

APPLICATION:
    │
    └─► How do you live when
        "master seems delayed"?
        │
        ├─ Church has existed 2000 years
        │   "Where is promise of coming?"
        │
        ├─ Temptation: "Delays mean won't come"
        │   Or: "Can get ready later"
        │
        └─► Truth: Delay tests faithfulness
            │
            → Those who presume on delay
              Will be caught by sudden return
              │
              → Readiness = living as if TODAY
                Not: Could be centuries
                IS: Could be now
```

### Why "No One Knows"

```
v. 36: NOT EVEN THE SON
    │
    └─► Theological puzzle:
        │
        ├─ Jesus is God
        ├─ God is omniscient
        └─► How can Son not know?

APPROACHES:
    │
    ├─ KENOSIS:
    │   └─► Phil 2:7 "Emptied himself"
    │       Voluntarily limited
    │       In incarnation
    │       │
    │       → Functional not ontological
    │         Chose not to access
    │
    ├─ HUMAN NATURE:
    │   └─► Speaking from human nature
    │       Not: Divine nature ignorant
    │       IS: Human nature limited
    │
    └─► ROLE/FUNCTION:
        └─► Son's role ≠ setting times
            Father reserves this
            (Acts 1:7)
            │
            → Not about capability
              About authority/role

WHY REVEAL THIS?
    │
    └─► If JESUS doesn't know the day
        │
        ├─ Don't pretend YOU can know
        │   Date-setting = presumption
        │
        ├─ Don't follow those who claim to know
        │   They're lying or deceived
        │
        └─► Focus on READINESS not calculation
            │
            → Ignorance is protective
              Forces constant alertness
              Prevents presumption
```

### Readiness vs. Date-Setting

```
THE ERROR:
    │
    └─► Throughout history:
        │
        ├─ 1000 AD expectations
        ├─ 1844 Great Disappointment
        ├─ 1988 "88 Reasons Why..."
        ├─ Y2K fears
        ├─ 2012 Mayan calendar
        └─► Countless others
            │
            ALL WRONG
            │
            Why?
            │
            → v. 36: NO ONE KNOWS

THE COMMAND:
    │
    └─► NOT: Calculate the day
        │
        IS: WATCH
            BE READY
            │
            → Different orientation:
              │
              Date-setting:
              ├─ Focus on WHEN
              ├─ Calculate from signs
              └─► Urgency tied to date
                  (Fades when date passes)
              │
              Readiness:
              ├─ Focus on HOW you live
              ├─ Signs increase urgency
              └─► Urgency is constant
                  (Always "could be today")

WHAT READINESS IS:
    │
    └─► Faithful service (v. 45)
        │
        ├─ Do assigned work
        │   Whatever God called you to
        │
        ├─ Care for others
        │   Serve fellow servants
        │
        ├─ Stay alert
        │   Don't be spiritually asleep
        │
        └─► Maintain urgency
            Don't presume on time
            │
            → Readiness = living NOW
              As if master returns TODAY
              │
              Not: Abandon normal life
              IS: Live normal life faithfully
```
