# Matthew 6: A Single-Audience Life

> The chapter asks one question four ways: Who are you living for? Your audience (God or crowds), your treasure (heaven or earth), your eye (single or divided), your master (God or money)—all point to the same issue. Divided loyalty is impossible. You cannot serve two masters. Get the audience right, and worry dissolves; get it wrong, and even your religious acts become performance.

## The Four Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Question | False Answer | True Answer |
|---------|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Audience** | Who your actions are performed for | "Who am I trying to please?" | The crowd | The Father |
| **Treasure** | What you depend on for security | "What makes me feel safe?" | Earthly accumulation | Heavenly investment |
| **Eye** | What governs your focus and perception | "What am I looking at?" | Divided/stingy (πονηρός) | Single/generous (ἁπλοῦς) |
| **Master** | What you obey when forced to choose | "Who wins when priorities conflict?" | Mammon | God |

## Conceptual Flow

```
MATTHEW 6 STRUCTURE
    │
    ├─ vv. 1-18   AUDIENCE    → Who are you performing for?
    │   ├─ Giving
    │   ├─ Prayer
    │   └─ Fasting
    │
    ├─ vv. 19-21  TREASURE    → Where is your security stored?
    │
    ├─ vv. 22-23  EYE         → What shapes your perception?
    │
    ├─ v. 24      MASTER      → Who do you obey under pressure?
    │
    └─ vv. 25-34  RESULT      → If first four are right, worry dissolves
```

---

## The Logical Chain

```
AUDIENCE determines TREASURE
    │
    └─► Playing to crowds → store earthly treasure (reputation, approval)
        Playing to Father → store heavenly treasure (secret obedience)

TREASURE shapes EYE
    │
    └─► Heart follows treasure (v. 21)
        What you invest in, you focus on
        What you focus on, you see through

EYE reveals MASTER
    │
    └─► Divided eye = divided loyalty
        What you look at determines what you serve
        "If the light in you is darkness..." (v. 23)

MASTER determines AUDIENCE
    │
    └─► Mammon demands visible performance (prove your worth)
        God operates in secret (knows your worth)
        │
        └─► Full circle back to AUDIENCE
```

**One-line summary:** Your audience shapes your treasure, your treasure shapes your eye, your eye reveals your master, and your master defines your audience.

---

## Section Analysis

### 1. Giving (vv. 1-4) — AUDIENCE

**Key Greek:** ἀπέχουσιν (apechousin) — "paid in full" (receipt stamped, transaction closed)

```
THE SPLIT
    │
    ├─ HYPOCRITE: Announces giving → Audience sees → Reward: applause
    │   └─► Transaction complete. Nothing more coming.
    │
    └─ DISCIPLE: Gives in secret → Father sees → Reward: from Father
        └─► Transaction pending. Payment in full later.
```

**Diagnostic:** *When you give, does anyone need to know?*

**One-line:** Generosity that needs witnesses has already been paid.

---

### 2. Prayer (vv. 5-15) — AUDIENCE

**Key Greek:** βατταλογέω (battalogeo) — "babble" (attempt to manipulate through volume)

```
TWO WRONG PRAYERS
    │
    ├─ HYPOCRITE'S PRAYER: Public performance
    │   └─► Audience: other people
    │
    └─ PAGAN'S PRAYER: Word multiplication
        └─► Audience: a god who doesn't know/care

THE LORD'S PRAYER: Structured intimacy
    │
    ├─ Address: "Our Father" (relationship, not manipulation)
    ├─ God's agenda first (name, kingdom, will)
    └─ Our needs second (bread, debts, protection)
```

#### The Lord's Prayer Unpacked

| Petition | Focus | What We're Asking |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Hallowed be your name** | God's honor | Let your name be revered, not profaned |
| **Your kingdom come** | God's rule | Let your reign break in fully |
| **Your will be done** | God's plan | Let earth mirror heaven's obedience |
| **Daily bread** | Provision | Just today—not hoarding |
| **Forgive our debts** | Pardon | Cancel what we owe |
| **As we forgive** | Grace flow | We release others too |
| **Lead us not into temptation** | Protection | Don't let us be tested beyond capacity |
| **Deliver from evil one** | Rescue | Snatch us from Satan's grip |

#### The Forgiveness Warning (vv. 14-15)

```
THE CONDITION
    │
    ├─ "IF you forgive others...
    │   your heavenly Father WILL ALSO forgive you"
    │
    └─► "But IF you do NOT forgive others...
         your Father WILL NOT forgive your sins"
        │
        └─► Unforgiveness = blocked pipeline
            You can't receive what you refuse to give
```

**Diagnostic:** *Does my prayer inform God or align me with Him?*

**One-line:** Prayer is calibration, not information transfer.

---

### 3. Fasting (vv. 16-18) — AUDIENCE

```
THE INVERSION
    │
    ├─ HYPOCRITE: Looks miserable → Visible suffering → Human pity
    │
    └─ DISCIPLE: Looks normal → Hidden hunger → Father's notice
```

**Diagnostic:** *Would this discipline mean anything if no one ever found out?*

**One-line:** Hidden discipline proves who you're actually hungry for.

---

### 4. Treasure (vv. 19-21) — TREASURE

**Key insight:** v. 21 is diagnostic, not prescriptive. Jesus doesn't say "put your heart in heaven." He says your treasure location *reveals* where your heart already is.

```
THE TWO VAULTS
    │
    ├─ EARTH: Moths, rust, thieves
    │   └─► Temporary, vulnerable, anxious
    │
    └─ HEAVEN: No decay, no theft
        └─► Permanent, secure, peaceful

THE DIAGNOSTIC (v. 21):
    │
    └─► "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also"
        │
        └─► Not: Move your heart, then treasure follows
            IS: Move your treasure, heart will follow
```

**Diagnostic:** *If I follow my spending, where does it lead?*

**One-line:** Investment creates attachment—your money trains your heart.

---

### 5. Eye (vv. 22-23) — EYE

**Key Greek:**
- ἁπλοῦς (haplous) — "single, simple, generous"
- πονηρός (ponēros) — "evil, bad, stingy" (Jewish idiom for covetousness)

```
THE EYE AS LENS
    │
    ├─ HEALTHY EYE (ἁπλοῦς):
    │   ├─ Undivided focus
    │   ├─ Generous perception
    │   └─► Whole body full of light
    │
    └─ UNHEALTHY EYE (πονηρός):
        ├─ Divided focus
        ├─ Stingy perception
        └─► Whole body full of darkness
            │
            └─► "If the light in you IS darkness..."
                Your guiding vision itself is corrupted
```

**Diagnostic:** *Am I seeing opportunities to give or opportunities to get?*

**One-line:** What you look at determines what you see—and what sees through you.

---

### 6. Masters (v. 24) — MASTER

**Key Greek:** δουλεύειν (douleuein) — "to serve as a slave" (not employment, but ownership)

```
THE IMPOSSIBILITY
    │
    └─► "No one CAN serve two masters"
        │
        ├─ Not: "should not"
        ├─ Not: "ought not"
        └─► IS: structurally impossible
            │
            ├─ "Hate one / Love other"
            └─ "Devoted to one / Despise other"
                │
                └─► No 50/50. No balance. No compromise.
                    Allegiance is binary at the root.
```

**Diagnostic:** *When God's call and financial security conflict, which wins?*

**One-line:** Mammon isn't money—it's money demanding the loyalty only God deserves.

---

### 7. Worry (vv. 25-34) — RESULT

**Key Greek:** μεριμνάω (merimnaō) — "to be anxious, divided in mind" (from μερίζω, "to divide")

```
THE LOGIC
    │
    ├─ IF your AUDIENCE is the Father → no need to perform
    ├─ IF your TREASURE is in heaven → nothing here can be lost
    ├─ IF your EYE is single → you see provision, not scarcity
    ├─ IF your MASTER is God → He assumes responsibility for you
    │
    └─► THEREFORE: Worry is structurally unnecessary
        │
        └─► "Seek FIRST his kingdom and righteousness,
             and all these things will be given to you"
```

#### The Arguments Against Worry

| Argument | Verse | Logic |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Birds | 26 | They don't produce, yet Father feeds them |
| Futility | 27 | Worry adds nothing |
| Flowers | 28-30 | They don't strive, yet Father clothes them |
| Pagans | 32 | They worry because they have no Father |
| Priority | 33 | Seek kingdom first → provision follows |
| Boundary | 34 | Today's grace is for today only |

```
ARGUMENT 1: BIRDS (v. 26)
    │
    ├─ They don't sow, reap, or store
    ├─ Yet "your heavenly Father FEEDS them"
    │
    └─► "Are you not MUCH MORE VALUABLE than they?"
        │
        └─► A fortiori: If God feeds birds who can't work,
            how much more you who can?

ARGUMENT 2: FUTILITY (v. 27)
    │
    └─► "Can any one of you by WORRYING
         add a single hour to your life?"
        │
        └─► Worry changes nothing
            except your peace

ARGUMENT 3: FLOWERS (vv. 28-30)
    │
    ├─ "See how the flowers of the field GROW"
    ├─ "They do not labor or spin"
    ├─ "Yet not even SOLOMON in all his splendor
    │   was dressed like one of these"
    │
    └─► "If that is how God clothes the GRASS...
         which is here today and tomorrow thrown into fire...
         will he not MUCH MORE clothe YOU?"
        │
        └─► "You of LITTLE FAITH" (ὀλιγόπιστοι)
            Small faith = big worry

ARGUMENT 4: PAGANS (v. 32)
    │
    ├─ "The PAGANS run after all these things"
    │   │
    │   └─► Food, drink, clothes = their obsession
    │       No Father to trust
    │
    └─► "Your heavenly Father KNOWS
         that you NEED them"
        │
        └─► Worry = living like an orphan
            when you have a Father

ARGUMENT 5: PRIORITY (v. 33)
    │
    └─► "But SEEK FIRST his kingdom
         and his righteousness,
         and ALL THESE THINGS will be given to you as well"
        │
        ├─ SEEK = present imperative (keep seeking)
        ├─ FIRST = priority, not just chronology
        └─► Kingdom + Righteousness = God's agenda
            Everything else follows

ARGUMENT 6: BOUNDARY (v. 34)
    │
    └─► "Do NOT worry about TOMORROW,
         for tomorrow will worry about itself.
         EACH DAY has enough trouble of its own"
        │
        └─► Today's grace is for today's problems
            Tomorrow has its own supply
            Borrowing future trouble = carrying weight
            you weren't designed to hold
```

**Diagnostic:** *What am I worried about that a good Father would obviously handle?*

**One-line:** Worry is practical atheism—living as if you have no Father.

---

## Unified Framework

```
THE SINGLE-AUDIENCE LIFE
    │
    ├─ AUDIENCE: I perform for the Father alone
    │   └─► Giving, prayer, fasting = private
    │
    ├─ TREASURE: I store in heaven
    │   └─► Heart follows investment
    │
    ├─ EYE: I focus on kingdom priorities
    │   └─► Generosity, not accumulation
    │
    ├─ MASTER: I serve God when forced to choose
    │   └─► Mammon loses every conflict
    │
    └─► RESULT: Anxiety dissolves
        │
        └─► The Father who sees in secret
            provides in the open
```

---

## Diagnostic Summary

| Section | Core Question |
|---------|---------------|
| Giving | Does anyone need to know I gave? |

| Fasting | Would this matter if no one found out? |
| Treasure | Where does my spending lead? |
| Eye | Am I seeing chances to give or get? |
| Master | When God and money conflict, which wins? |
| Worry | What am I anxious about that a Father handles? |

---

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Matthew 6:** The person who plays to an audience of One stores treasure where it can't decay, sees with undivided focus, serves a single Master, and therefore has no structural reason to worry.
