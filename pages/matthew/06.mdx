# Matthew 6 - The King's Practice

## Overview
Jesus teaches the inner life of the kingdom - how to give, pray, fast, and trust without performing for an audience.

## Chapter Structure

```
Matthew 6
├─ vv. 1-4   : Giving to the Needy    (Secret generosity)
├─ vv. 5-15  : Prayer                  (The Lord's Prayer)

```

---

## The Key Principle (v. 1)

```
THE AUDIENCE QUESTION
    │
    └─► "Be careful not to practice your righteousness
         in front of others TO BE SEEN BY THEM"
        │
        ├─ Righteousness FOR an audience = No reward from Father
        └─ Righteousness BEFORE the Father = Eternal reward

WHO ARE YOU PERFORMING FOR?
    │
    ├─ HYPOCRITES: Play to the crowd → Reward: Human applause (that's it)
    └─ DISCIPLES: Play to the Father → Reward: Father's approval
```

---

## vv. 1-4: Giving to the Needy

```
THE HYPOCRITE'S WAY (vv. 1-2)
    │
    ├─ "Announce it with trumpets"
    ├─ In synagogues and streets
    ├─ Purpose: "To be HONORED by others"
    │
    └─► "They have received their reward IN FULL"
        │
        └─► Greek: ἀπέχουσιν (apechousin) = "paid in full"
            Receipt stamped. Transaction complete.
            Nothing more coming.

THE DISCIPLE'S WAY (vv. 3-4)
    │
    ├─ "Do not let your LEFT HAND know
    │   what your RIGHT HAND is doing"
    │   │
    │   └─► Hyperbole: Give so secretly
    │       you almost forget you did it
    │
    └─► "Your Father, who SEES what is done in secret,
         will REWARD you"
```

### One-Line Cut
**If you need people to know you gave, you've already been paid - in applause that fades.**

---

## vv. 5-15: Prayer

### The Wrong Way (vv. 5-8)

```
HYPOCRITE'S PRAYER (vv. 5-6)
    │
    ├─ Standing in synagogues
    ├─ Street corners
    ├─ Purpose: "To be SEEN by others"
    │
    └─► Reward received in full

PAGAN'S PRAYER (vv. 7-8)
    │
    ├─ "Babbling" (βατταλογέω)
    │   │
    │   └─► Repetitious, meaningless words
    │       Trying to manipulate by volume
    │
    ├─ "They think they will be heard
    │   because of their MANY WORDS"
    │
    └─► Jesus: "Your Father KNOWS what you need
              BEFORE you ask him"
```

### The Lord's Prayer (vv. 9-13)

```
STRUCTURE
    │
    ├─ ADDRESS: "Our Father in heaven"
    │
    ├─ GOD'S CONCERNS (vv. 9b-10):
    │   ├─ "Hallowed be your NAME"
    │   ├─ "Your KINGDOM come"
    │   └─ "Your WILL be done, on earth as in heaven"
    │
    └─ OUR NEEDS (vv. 11-13):
        ├─ "Give us today our daily BREAD"        → Physical
        ├─ "Forgive us our DEBTS"                 → Relational
        └─ "Lead us not into TEMPTATION"          → Spiritual
            └─► "Deliver us from the EVIL ONE"
```

### The Prayer Unpacked

| Petition | Focus | What We're Asking |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Hallowed be your name** | God's honor | Let your name be revered, not profaned |
| **Your kingdom come** | God's rule | Let your reign break in fully |
| **Your will be done** | God's plan | Let earth mirror heaven's obedience |
| **Daily bread** | Provision | Just today - not hoarding |
| **Forgive our debts** | Pardon | Cancel what we owe |
| **As we forgive** | Grace flow | We release others too |
| **Lead us not into temptation** | Protection | Don't let us be tested beyond capacity |
| **Deliver from evil one** | Rescue | Snatch us from Satan's grip |

### The Forgiveness Warning (vv. 14-15)

```
THE CONDITION
    │
    ├─ "IF you forgive others...
    │   your heavenly Father WILL ALSO forgive you"
    │
    └─► "But IF you do NOT forgive others...
         your Father WILL NOT forgive your sins"
        │
        └─► Unforgiveness = blocked pipeline
            You can't receive what you refuse to give
```

### One-Line Cut
**Prayer isn't informing God or impressing people - it's aligning your heart with the Father who already knows.**

---

## vv. 16-18: Fasting

```
HYPOCRITE'S FAST (v. 16)
    │
    ├─ "Look somber"
    ├─ "Disfigure their faces"
    ├─ Purpose: "To SHOW others they are fasting"
    │
    └─► Reward received in full (human pity)

DISCIPLE'S FAST (vv. 17-18)
    │
    ├─ "Put OIL on your head"
    ├─ "WASH your face"
    │   │
    │   └─► Look NORMAL, even refreshed
    │
    └─► "Only your Father, who is UNSEEN...
         will reward you"
```

### One-Line Cut
**Fast to be seen by God, not pitied by people - your hunger is between you and the Father.**

---

## vv. 19-24: Treasures and Masters

### Two Treasuries (vv. 19-21)

```
EARTHLY TREASURE (v. 19)
    │
    ├─ Moths destroy (clothing)
    ├─ Vermin destroy (grain)
    ├─ Thieves break in and steal
    │
    └─► Everything here is temporary

HEAVENLY TREASURE (v. 20)
    │
    ├─ No moths
    ├─ No vermin
    ├─ No thieves
    │
    └─► Permanent, secure, eternal

THE DIAGNOSTIC (v. 21)
    │
    └─► "Where your TREASURE is,
         there your HEART will be also"
        │
        └─► Your investments reveal your loves
            Follow the money, find the heart
```

### The Eye as Lamp (vv. 22-23)

```
THE EYE = What you FOCUS on
    │
    ├─ HEALTHY eye → Whole body FULL OF LIGHT
    │   │
    │   └─► "Healthy" (ἁπλοῦς) = single, generous, undivided
    │
    └─ UNHEALTHY eye → Whole body FULL OF DARKNESS
        │
        └─► "Unhealthy" (πονηρός) = evil, stingy, divided

"If the light within you IS DARKNESS,
 how great is that darkness!"
    │
    └─► When your guiding vision is corrupted,
        everything else goes dark
```

### Two Masters (v. 24)

```
THE IMPOSSIBILITY
    │
    └─► "No one can serve TWO masters"
        │
        ├─ "Either you will HATE the one
        │   and LOVE the other"
        │
        └─ "Or you will be DEVOTED to the one
            and DESPISE the other"
    │
    CONCLUSION:
    │
    └─► "You CANNOT serve both God and money"
        │
        └─► "Money" = μαμωνᾶς (mamōnas)
            Wealth personified as a rival god
```

### One-Line Cut
**Your eye determines your direction, your treasure reveals your heart, and you can only bow to one master - choose.**

---

## vv. 25-34: Do Not Worry

### The Command (v. 25)

```
"THEREFORE I tell you, DO NOT WORRY about..."
    │
    ├─ Your LIFE - what you will eat or drink
    ├─ Your BODY - what you will wear
    │
    └─► "Is not LIFE more than food,
         and the BODY more than clothes?"
        │
        └─► The One who gave the greater (life)
            will provide the lesser (food)
```

### The Arguments

```
ARGUMENT 1: BIRDS (v. 26)
    │
    ├─ They don't sow, reap, or store
    ├─ Yet "your heavenly Father FEEDS them"
    │
    └─► "Are you not MUCH MORE VALUABLE than they?"

ARGUMENT 2: FUTILITY (v. 27)
    │
    └─► "Can any one of you by WORRYING
         add a single hour to your life?"
        │
        └─► Worry changes nothing
            except your peace

ARGUMENT 3: FLOWERS (vv. 28-30)
    │
    ├─ "See how the flowers of the field GROW"
    ├─ "They do not labor or spin"
    ├─ "Yet not even SOLOMON in all his splendor
    │   was dressed like one of these"
    │
    └─► "If that is how God clothes the GRASS...
         which is here today and tomorrow thrown into fire...
         will he not MUCH MORE clothe YOU?"
        │
        └─► "You of LITTLE FAITH"
```

### The Contrast (vv. 31-32)

```
DON'T BE LIKE PAGANS
    │
    ├─ "The PAGANS run after all these things"
    │   │
    │   └─► Food, drink, clothes = their obsession
    │       No Father to trust
    │
    └─► "Your heavenly Father KNOWS
         that you NEED them"
```

### The Solution (vv. 33-34)

```
THE PRIORITY
    │
    └─► "But SEEK FIRST his kingdom
         and his righteousness,
         and ALL THESE THINGS will be given to you as well"
        │
        ├─ SEEK = present imperative (keep seeking)
        ├─ FIRST = priority, not just chronology
        └─► Kingdom + Righteousness = God's agenda

THE BOUNDARY
    │
    └─► "Do NOT worry about TOMORROW,
         for tomorrow will worry about itself.
         EACH DAY has enough trouble of its own"
        │
        └─► Today's grace is for today's problems
            Tomorrow has its own supply
```

### One-Line Cut
**Worry is practical atheism - it forgets you have a Father who sees the sparrows and counts your hairs.**

    │

        What you do when no one's watching
        reveals who you really are
```
