## The Four Movements

| Section | Focus | Core Principle |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Transfiguration** (vv. 1-13) | Glory unveiled | Divine identity confirmed; Moses/Elijah = Law/Prophets fulfilled |
| **Failed Exorcism** (vv. 14-21) | Disciples fail | Faith isn't technique—it's connection to power source |
| **Death Prediction** (vv. 22-23) | Path to glory | Glory comes through suffering, not around it |
| **Temple Tax** (vv. 24-27) | Kingdom economics | Sons are free, but wisdom defers for mission |

## Conceptual Flow

```
MATTHEW 17 STRUCTURE
    │
    ├─ vv. 1-13   TRANSFIGURATION → Glory Revealed
    │   ├─► Mountain: Jesus transformed, face like sun
    │   ├─► Moses + Elijah appear (Law + Prophets)
    │   ├─► Peter: "Let's build shelters" (wrong response)
    │   ├─► Father's voice: "This is my Son—LISTEN TO HIM"
    │   └─► Descent: Elijah = John the Baptist (already came)
    │       Suffering precedes glory
    │
    ├─ vv. 14-21  FAILED EXORCISM → Faith Tested
    │   ├─► Disciples couldn't heal demon-possessed boy
    │   ├─► "Unbelieving and perverse generation"
    │   ├─► Jesus heals instantly
    │   └─► Why failure? "Little faith"
    │       Mustard seed faith moves mountains
    │
    ├─ vv. 22-23  DEATH PREDICTION → Glory Through Death
    │   ├─► "Son of Man will be delivered"
    │   ├─► Killed → raised on third day
    │   └─► Disciples: filled with grief
    │       Still not grasping resurrection hope
    │
    └─ vv. 24-27  TEMPLE TAX → Kingdom Economics
        ├─► Question: "Does your teacher pay temple tax?"
        ├─► Jesus: "Kings tax others, not their children"
        ├─► Sons of kingdom = exempt
        └─► But: Pay anyway (not to cause offense)
            Miraculous provision: coin in fish's mouth
```

## The Glory Architecture

```
CHAPTER 16 ENDS:
    │
    └─► "Some standing here will not taste death
         before they see the Son of Man
         coming in his kingdom" (16:28)
        │
        └─► CHAPTER 17 OPENS:
            │
            └─► "After SIX DAYS..."
                │
                └─► Fulfillment of promise
                    │
                    └─► Three disciples SEE glory
                        Preview of kingdom
                        Foretaste of resurrection reality

TRANSFIGURATION = ANSWER TO:
    │
    ├─ Peter's confession (16:16): "You are the Messiah"
    │   └─► NOW confirmed by Father's voice
    │
    ├─ Peter's rebuke (16:22): "Never, Lord!"
    │   └─► NOW corrected: suffering THEN glory
    │
    └─► Promise of kingdom glimpse (16:28)
        └─► NOW fulfilled: glory revealed
```

```
THE PATTERN ESTABLISHED:
    │
    └─► MOUNTAIN = Glory
        │
        └─► Down from mountain = Suffering
            │
            └─► This is the ORDER:
                │
                ├─ See glory (Transfiguration)
                ├─ Enter suffering (failed disciples, death prediction)
                └─► Glory through suffering (not around it)

SAME PATTERN REPEATED:
    │
    ├─ Moses on Sinai → Glory
    │   └─► Down to golden calf → Suffering
    │
    ├─ Elijah on Carmel → Victory
    │   └─► Down to flee Jezebel → Suffering
    │
    └─► Jesus on Transfiguration mount → Glory
        └─► Down to cross → Suffering → Resurrection
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. The Transfiguration (vv. 1-13) — GLORY REVEALED

```
THE SETTING (v. 1)
    │
    └─► "After SIX DAYS"
        │
        ├─ Why six days?
        │   │
        │   └─► Echoes Exodus 24:16:
        │       │
        │       └─► "The glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai.
        │            For SIX DAYS the cloud covered the mountain;
        │            on the SEVENTH day the LORD called to Moses
        │            from within the cloud"
        │           │
        │           └─► Same pattern:
        │               Six days of waiting
        │               Then glory revealed
        │
        └─► "HIGH MOUNTAIN by themselves"
            │
            └─► Location debated:
                │
                ├─ Mount Tabor (traditional)
                │   └─► Problem: not "high" (only 1,800 ft)
                │       Had fortification on top
                │
                └─► Mount Hermon (more likely)
                    └─► 9,200 ft at summit
                        Near Caesarea Philippi
                        (where Peter's confession happened)
                        │
                        └─► Truly "high mountain"
                            Private, isolated
```

```
THE INNER THREE
    │
    └─► Peter, James, and John
        │
        └─► Why only these three?
            │
            ├─ Same three at:
            │   │
            │   ├─ Jairus' daughter raising (Mark 5:37)
            │   ├─ Gethsemane agony (Matt 26:37)
            │   └─► Mount of Olives discourse (Mark 13:3)
            │
            └─► Pattern: Privileged witnesses to:
                │
                ├─ Power over death (Jairus)
                ├─ Glory revealed (Transfiguration)
                └─► Deepest suffering (Gethsemane)
                    │
                    └─► Can't witness glory
                        Without witnessing suffering
                        They're linked
```

**The Transformation (v. 2):**

```
"HE WAS TRANSFIGURED BEFORE THEM"
    │
    └─► μετεμορφώθη (metemorphōthē)
        │
        └─► Not: external change of appearance
            IS: revealing of true nature
            │
            └─► The veil lifted
                │
                └─► What was hidden = now visible
                    Divine glory shining through humanity

"HIS FACE SHONE LIKE THE SUN"
    │
    └─► Compare:
        │
        ├─ Moses' face (Ex 34:29-35):
        │   └─► Reflected glory from being with God
        │       Faded over time
        │       Had to be veiled
        │
        └─► Jesus' face:
            └─► Inherent glory from within
                Not reflected, but SOURCE
                │
                └─► 2 Cor 4:6: "The light of the knowledge
                               of God's glory displayed
                               in the FACE OF CHRIST"

"HIS CLOTHES BECAME WHITE AS LIGHT"
    │
    └─► λευκὰ ὡς τὸ φῶς
        "White as THE light"
        │
        └─► Not just white fabric
            Light itself
            │
            └─► Mark adds: "dazzling white,
                           whiter than anyone in the world
                           could bleach them" (9:3)
                │
                └─► Supernatural brilliance
                    Beyond earthly whiteness
```

```
WHAT DISCIPLES SAW:
    │
    └─► Preview of resurrection body
        │
        └─► Phil 3:21: "He will transform our lowly bodies
                        so that they will be LIKE
                        his GLORIOUS BODY"
            │
            └─► This is what's coming:
                Glorified humanity
                Physical but transformed
                │
                └─► Rev 1:16: "His face was like
                              the sun shining
                              in all its brilliance"
                    │
                    └─► Same description
                        Transfiguration = preview
                        Revelation = permanent state
```

**Moses and Elijah (v. 3):**

```
"MOSES AND ELIJAH, TALKING WITH JESUS"
    │
    └─► Why these two?
        │
        ├─ MOSES = The Law
        │   │
        │   ├─ Gave Torah at Sinai
        │   ├─ Mediator of old covenant
        │   └─► Deut 18:15: "The LORD your God
        │                    will raise up for you
        │                    a prophet LIKE ME"
        │       │
        │       └─► Moses predicted greater prophet
        │           Now stands WITH Him
        │
        └─► ELIJAH = The Prophets
            │
            ├─ Greatest of prophets
            ├─ Confronted false worship
            └─► Mal 4:5: "I will send the prophet ELIJAH
                         before that great and dreadful
                         day of the LORD"
                │
                └─► Prophesied to return
                    Here he is with Jesus

TOGETHER:
    │
    └─► Law + Prophets = entire Old Testament
        │
        └─► Both point to Jesus
            Both fulfilled in Jesus
            │
            └─► Luke 24:27: "Beginning with MOSES
                            and all the PROPHETS,
                            he explained what was said
                            in all the Scriptures
                            concerning HIMSELF"
```

```
WHAT WERE THEY DISCUSSING?
    │
    └─► Luke 9:31 reveals:
        │
        └─► "They spoke about his DEPARTURE
             which he was about to bring to fulfillment
             at Jerusalem"
            │
            └─► ἔξοδον (exodon) — "exodus, departure"
                │
                └─► His death = His "exodus"
                    │
                    └─► Moses led exodus from Egypt
                        Jesus leads exodus from sin/death
                        │
                        └─► Greater liberation
                            Not from Pharaoh
                            From Satan, sin, death

THEIR UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:
    │
    ├─ Moses: Knew suffering for God's people
    │   └─► 40 years in wilderness
    │       People rebelled constantly
    │       Saw promised land, couldn't enter
    │
    └─► Elijah: Knew rejection by Israel
        └─► Hunted by Jezebel
            "I alone am left"
            Taken to heaven without dying
            │
            └─► Both knew:
                Serving God = suffering
                Now with Jesus discussing HIS suffering
```

**Peter's Response (v. 4):**

```
"LORD, IT IS GOOD FOR US TO BE HERE"
    │
    └─► True statement
        │
        └─► καλόν ἐστιν ἡμᾶς ὧδε εἶναι
            "Good it is for us here to be"
            │
            └─► Who wouldn't want to stay?
                Glory visible
                Heaven touching earth
                No suffering here

"I WILL PUT UP THREE SHELTERS"
    │
    └─► σκηνάς (skēnas) — "tents, tabernacles"
        │
        └─► Why shelters?
            │
            ├─ Feast of Tabernacles connection:
            │   └─► Jews built booths
            │       Remembered wilderness wandering
            │       Anticipated messianic age
            │
            └─► Peter's logic:
                │
                ├─ "This must be IT"
                ├─ Messianic age arriving
                ├─ Let's preserve this moment
                └─► Make it permanent
                    │
                    └─► PROBLEM:
                        │
                        └─► Trying to skip the cross
                            Stay on mountaintop
                            Bypass Jerusalem
```

```
PETER'S ERROR:
    │
    ├─ Error #1: Equalizing Jesus with Moses/Elijah
    │   └─► "One for you, one for Moses, one for Elijah"
    │       │
    │       └─► Three equal shelters
    │           Three great figures
    │           │
    │           BUT: Jesus isn't one of three
    │           Jesus is the ONE they all point to
    │
    ├─ Error #2: Wanting to institutionalize the moment
    │   └─► Build structures
    │       Capture the experience
    │       │
    │       └─► Can't contain glory in buildings
    │           Glory is a Person, not a place
    │
    └─► Error #3: Avoiding what comes next
        └─► Stay on mountain = skip cross
            │
            └─► Same error as 16:22:
                "Never, Lord!"
                │
                └─► Peter still doesn't get it:
                    Glory comes THROUGH suffering
                    Not instead of it
```

```
MARK'S COMMENTARY (9:6):
    │
    └─► "He did not know what to say,
         they were so frightened"
        │
        └─► Peter blurting
            Not thinking
            Fear response
            │
            └─► When overwhelmed by glory:
                Human response = try to manage it
                Build something
                Control it
                │
                └─► Can't control God's glory
                    Can only receive it
```

**The Father Speaks (v. 5):**

```
"A BRIGHT CLOUD COVERED THEM"
    │
    └─► νεφέλη φωτεινή — "cloud luminous"
        │
        └─► THE SHEKINAH:
            │
            ├─ Ex 40:34-35: Cloud covered tabernacle
            │   Glory of LORD filled it
            │
            ├─ 1 Kings 8:10-11: Cloud filled temple
            │   Priests couldn't stand to minister
            │
            └─► Same glory cloud
                Same divine presence
                │
                └─► God's presence in cloud:
                    Conceals and reveals simultaneously
                    Too bright to see fully
                    Too real to deny

"THIS IS MY SON, WHOM I LOVE;
 WITH HIM I AM WELL PLEASED.
 LISTEN TO HIM!"
    │
    └─► Three statements:
        │
        ├─ IDENTITY: "This is my Son"
        │   │
        │   └─► Not one of three great figures
        │       THE Son
        │       Unique relationship
        │       │
        │       └─► Answers 16:16:
        │           Peter: "You are the Son of the living God"
        │           Father: "Yes, He is MY SON"
        │
        ├─ AFFECTION: "Whom I love; well pleased"
        │   │
        │   └─► ὁ ἀγαπητός — "the beloved one"
        │       │
        │       └─► Same words as baptism (3:17)
        │           Father's delight unchanged
        │           Even facing cross
        │
        └─► COMMAND: "LISTEN TO HIM"
            │
            └─► ἀκούετε αὐτοῦ — "hear/obey him"
                │
                └─► Direct quote: Deut 18:15

THE FATHER'S CORRECTION OF PETER:

"DON'T TELL ANYONE... UNTIL RAISED FROM DEAD" (v. 9)

            │
            ├─ Must see cross first
            │   └─► Glory through suffering
            │       Not glory instead of suffering
            │
            └─► After resurrection:
                └─► THEN tell everyone
                    THEN it makes sense
                    Cross + resurrection = complete picture
                    │
                    └─► 2 Peter 1:16-18:
                        Peter DOES tell—later
                        "We were eyewitnesses of his majesty"

"WHY DO SCRIBES SAY ELIJAH MUST COME FIRST?" (v. 10)
    │
    └─► Their confusion:
        │
        └─► Just saw Elijah
            But Malachi says Elijah comes BEFORE Messiah
            │
            └─► Mal 4:5: "I will send the prophet Elijah

                    ├─ And Elijah must come first...
                    ├─ But we just saw Elijah NOW...
                    └─► How does this work?

JESUS' ANSWER (vv. 11-12):

                                └─► Suffering precedes glory
                                    For forerunner AND Messiah

DISCIPLES' UNDERSTANDING (v. 13):

                │
                └─► John's ministry:

                    ├─ Called Israel to repentance
                    ├─ Prepared way for Messiah

THE CONTRAST:

    └─► MOUNTAIN: Glory, presence, power
        │
        └─► VALLEY: Suffering, failure, demons
            │
            └─► Always this pattern:
                │
                ├─ Moses descends → golden calf
                ├─ Elijah descends → flees Jezebel
                └─► Jesus descends → disciples failed
                    │
                    └─► Mountaintop experiences
                        Don't eliminate valley challenges
                        Must return to broken world

                         foams at mouth, gnashes teeth,

            ├─ Were sent out (10:1)

                                Still struggling with faith

WHO IS ADDRESSED?
    │
    ├─ Option 1: The crowd
    │   └─► General unbelief of Israel
    │
    ├─ Option 2: The disciples specifically
    │   └─► They had authority, failed to use it
    │
    └─► Option 3: All of them (most likely)
        └─► The whole atmosphere of unbelief
            Disciples caught in it
            Father's partial faith ("if you can")
            Crowd's spectacle-seeking
            │

            ├─ Peter (16:22)
            └─► Demons throughout ministry
                │
                └─► Authoritative command
                    No ritual

                    └─► Mark 9:25 records the command:
                        "You deaf and mute spirit, I command you,

**The Disciples' Question (vv. 19-20):**

```
"WHY COULDN'T WE DRIVE IT OUT?"
    │
    └─► Διὰ τί ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἠδυνήθημεν
        │
        └─► Honest question
            │
            └─► They had cast out demons before (10:8)
                This time: nothing
                │
                └─► What went wrong?
                    Different demon?
                    Different technique needed?
                    Lost the power?

JESUS' ANSWER: "BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO LITTLE FAITH"
    │
    └─► διὰ τὴν ὀλιγοπιστίαν ὑμῶν
        "Because of your little-faith"
        │
        └─► ὀλιγοπιστία — compound word:
            │
            ├─ ὀλίγος — "little, small"
            └─► πίστις — "faith"
                │
                └─► Not: NO faith
                    IS: LITTLE faith
                    │
                    └─► They had some faith
                        But not enough for this situation
                        │
                        └─► Some demons require MORE faith?
                            Or: their faith had shrunk?
```

```
THE MUSTARD SEED PRINCIPLE:
    │
    └─► "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed,
         you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,'
         and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
        │
        └─► Wait... seems contradictory:
            │
            ├─ Problem: "little faith"
            ├─ Solution: "mustard seed" (tiny!)
            │
            └─► How can TINY faith move mountains
                When LITTLE faith couldn't cast out demon?

THE RESOLUTION:
    │
    └─► It's not about SIZE of faith
        It's about QUALITY/OBJECT of faith
        │
        ├─ Mustard seed faith:
        │   └─► Small but GENUINE
        │       Small but ALIVE
        │       Small but GROWING
        │       Connected to unlimited power source
        │
        └─► Little faith (ὀλιγοπιστία):
            └─► Wavering
                Doubting
                Mixed with unbelief
                Not fully trusting
                │
                └─► Quantity present but quality lacking

THE ANALOGY:
    │
    └─► Electrical circuit:
        │
        ├─ Strong connection (mustard seed):
        │   └─► Small wire, but fully connected
        │       Full current flows
        │       Can power anything
        │
        └─► Weak connection (little faith):
            └─► Big wire, but corroded
                Resistance in circuit
                Current can't flow
                │
                └─► It's not wire size
                    It's connection quality
```

```
MOUNTAINS MOVING:
    │
    └─► "This mountain" — Which mountain?
        │
        └─► Just came down from mountain of Transfiguration
            │
            └─► Possible meaning:
                │
                ├─ Literal mountains (hyperbole for impossible)
                ├─ This specific mountain they're near
                └─► Any obstacle, any impossibility
                    │
                    └─► "Nothing will be impossible"
                        οὐδὲν ἀδυνατήσει ὑμῖν
                        │
                        └─► Faith connected to God
                            = Access to God's power
                            = No limits except God's will
```

**Verse 21 Note:**

```
[VERSE 21 — TEXTUAL ISSUE]
    │
    └─► Some manuscripts include:
        │
        └─► "But this kind does not go out
             except by prayer and fasting"
            │
            └─► Likely NOT original to Matthew
                │

                        └─► Some spiritual battles require:
                            │
                            ├─ Deeper prayer (connection)
                            └─► Fasting (focus, dependence)

                                └─► Not magic formula
                                    Intensified dependence on God

### 3. Second Death Prediction (vv. 22-23) — GLORY THROUGH DEATH

```
THE PREDICTION:
    │
    └─► "The Son of Man is going to be
         DELIVERED into the hands of men"
        │
        └─► παραδίδοσθαι — "handed over"
            │
            └─► Same word for:
                │
                ├─ Judas betraying Jesus (26:15)
                ├─ Pilate handing Jesus over (27:26)
                └─► Father delivering Son (Rom 8:32)
                    │
                    └─► Multiple levels of "handing over":
                        │
                        ├─ Judas hands to priests
                        ├─ Priests hand to Pilate
                        ├─ Pilate hands to soldiers
                        └─► Behind all: Father's sovereign plan

"THEY WILL KILL HIM"
    │
    └─► ἀποκτενοῦσιν αὐτόν
        │
        └─► No ambiguity
            Direct statement
            Violent death coming
            │
            └─► This is SECOND prediction
                │
                ├─ First: 16:21 — Detailed (Jerusalem, elders, chief priests, teachers)
                └─► Second: Simplified (delivered, killed, raised)
                    │
                    └─► Repetition for emphasis
                        They need to hear this again
                        And again (third time: 20:17-19)

"ON THE THIRD DAY HE WILL BE RAISED TO LIFE"
    │
    └─► τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἐγερθήσεται
        │
        └─► Third day = resurrection
            │
            └─► Not: "after three days" (vague)
                IS: "on the third day" (specific)
                │
                └─► Friday: death
                    Saturday: tomb
                    Sunday: resurrection
                    │
                    └─► "Raised" = passive
                        Father raises Son
                        Death doesn't end story
```

```
DISCIPLES' RESPONSE:
    │
    └─► "They were filled with grief"
        │
        └─► ἐλυπήθησαν σφόδρα — "grieved exceedingly"
            │
            └─► What did they hear?
                │
                ├─ HEARD: "killed"
                └─► MISSED: "raised to life"
                    │
                    └─► Grief blocked hope
                        Death overshadowed resurrection
                        │
                        └─► Same pattern as 16:22:
                            Peter: "Never, Lord!"
                            │
                            └─► Can't accept suffering Messiah
                                Still expecting triumphant king
                                Glory without cross

COMPARE TO CHAPTER 16:
    │
    ├─ First prediction: Peter REBUKES Jesus
    │   └─► Active resistance
    │
    └─► Second prediction: Disciples GRIEVE
        └─► Passive sorrow
            │
            └─► Progress? Maybe.
                │
                └─► At least not arguing
                    Beginning to accept?
                    But still not understanding resurrection
```

```
THE PATTERN EMERGING:
    │
    └─► TRANSFIGURATION → DEATH PREDICTION
        │
        └─► Just saw glory
            Now hear of death
            │
            └─► Mountaintop → valley
                Radiance → cross
                Moses/Elijah → "hands of men"
                │
                └─► Can't separate them:
                    │
                    ├─ Glory comes through death
                    ├─ Crown follows cross
                    └─► Resurrection requires crucifixion
                        │
                        └─► Phil 2:8-9: "He humbled himself
                                         by becoming obedient to death—
                                         even death on a cross!
                                         Therefore God exalted him
                                         to the highest place"
```

### 4. The Temple Tax (vv. 24-27) — FREEDOM AND WISDOM

```
THE TAX IN CONTEXT:
    │
    └─► "Two-drachma temple tax"
        │
        └─► Based on Exodus 30:11-16:
            │
            └─► Every male 20+ pays half-shekel
                For tabernacle/temple maintenance
                │
                └─► By Jesus' time:
                    │
                    ├─ Collected annually
                    ├─ Due in Adar (March)
                    ├─ Two drachmas = half-shekel
                    └─► About two days' wages
                        │
                        └─► NOT Roman tax
                            Jewish religious tax
                            For temple operations
```

**The Question (v. 24):**

```
"DOESN'T YOUR TEACHER PAY THE TEMPLE TAX?"
    │
    └─► Οὐ τελεῖ ὁ διδάσκαλος ὑμῶν τὰ δίδραχμα;
        │
        └─► The question implies:
            │
            ├─ Possible suspicion Jesus doesn't pay
            ├─ Testing His commitment to temple
            └─► Or just routine inquiry
                │
                └─► Why approach Peter, not Jesus?
                    │
                    └─► Perhaps easier target
                        Or Jesus wasn't visible
                        Peter as spokesman

PETER'S QUICK ANSWER: "Yes, he does"
    │
    └─► Ναί — "Yes"
        │
        └─► Immediate affirmation
            │
            └─► Peter assumes Jesus pays
                Doesn't want teacher seen as deviant
                Quick to defend Jesus' reputation
                │
                BUT: Did Peter check with Jesus first?
                │
                └─► No. He assumed.
                    Then went to find Jesus.
```

**Jesus' Preemptive Question (vv. 25-26):**

```
"JESUS WAS FIRST TO SPEAK"
    │
    └─► προέφθασεν αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς — "Jesus anticipated him"
        │
        └─► Before Peter could explain
            Jesus already knew
            │
            └─► Supernatural knowledge:
                │
                ├─ Knew the question
                ├─ Knew Peter's answer
                └─► Knew the teaching moment
                    │
                    └─► John 2:25: "He knew what was in each person"

"FROM WHOM DO KINGS COLLECT DUTY AND TAXES—
 FROM THEIR OWN CHILDREN OR FROM OTHERS?"
    │
    └─► The logic:
        │
        ├─ Kings tax their subjects
        ├─ Kings do NOT tax their own family
        └─► Royal children are EXEMPT
            │
            └─► Application:
                │
                ├─ Temple = Father's house (John 2:16)
                ├─ Jesus = Son of temple's Owner
                ├─ Therefore: Jesus exempt from temple tax
                │
                └─► "Then the children are exempt"
                    ἄρα γε ἐλεύθεροί εἰσιν οἱ υἱοί
                    │
                    └─► υἱοί (sons) = free from obligation
```

```
THE THEOLOGICAL CLAIM:
    │
    └─► Jesus is claiming to be:
        │
        ├─ Son of God (temple's Owner)
        │   └─► Therefore exempt from temple tax
        │
        └─► Greater than temple itself
            │
            └─► Matt 12:6: "One greater than the temple is here"
                │
                └─► If greater than temple
                    Not obligated TO temple
                    Temple exists for HIM
                    Not He for temple

BY EXTENSION:
    │
    └─► Disciples are also "sons"
        │
        └─► Part of Jesus' family
            Citizens of true kingdom
            │
            └─► Also technically exempt
                │
                └─► Gal 4:7: "So you are no longer a slave,
                              but God's child;
                              and since you are his child,
                              God has made you also an heir"
```

**The Wisdom of Paying Anyway (v. 27):**

```
"BUT SO THAT WE MAY NOT CAUSE OFFENSE..."
    │
    └─► ἵνα δὲ μὴ σκανδαλίσωμεν αὐτούς
        │
        └─► σκανδαλίζω — "to cause to stumble"
            │
            └─► Jesus' reasoning:
                │
                ├─ We ARE exempt (legal freedom)
                ├─ BUT: exercising freedom could stumble others
                └─► Therefore: voluntarily pay anyway
                    │
                    └─► Freedom doesn't mean:
                        "Assert all rights always"
                        │
                        Freedom means:
                        "Free to NOT assert rights"
                        For sake of mission
                        For sake of others
```

```
THE PAUL PRINCIPLE (same logic):
    │
    └─► 1 Cor 9:19: "Though I am free and belong to no one,
                     I have made myself a slave to everyone,
                     to win as many as possible"
        │
        └─► Freedom = ability to serve
            Not: demanding all rights
            IS: laying down rights for gospel
            │
            └─► 1 Cor 8:9: "Be careful that the exercise
                            of your rights does not become
                            a stumbling block to the weak"

JESUS MODELS THIS:
    │
    └─► He IS exempt
        He COULD refuse
        He CHOOSES to pay
        │
        └─► Why?
            │
            ├─ Not: because He owes it
            ├─ Not: because they're right to ask
            └─► IS: because mission matters more
                │
                └─► Refusing would:
                    │
                    ├─ Create unnecessary conflict
                    ├─ Distract from real message
                    ├─ Give enemies ammunition
                    └─► "He doesn't support temple!"
                        │
                        └─► Not worth the battle
                            Pick the right hills to die on
                            This isn't one of them
```

WHY THIS METHOD?
    │
    └─► Jesus could have:
        │
        ├─ Created coin from nothing
        ├─ Told Peter where to find money
        ├─ Asked disciples to contribute

                        └─► Teaching through experience
                            Not just lecture

THE MESSAGE:

    └─► If Jesus provides temple tax through fish
        │
        └─► He can provide for any need

## Personal Notes

### The Mountaintop Problem

I'm like Peter. I want to build shelters on mountaintops.

```
MY PATTERN:
    │
    └─► Experience God's presence
        │
        └─► Immediately try to:
            │
            ├─ Capture it
            ├─ Systematize it
            ├─ Make it repeatable
            └─► Stay there forever
                │
                └─► Problem:
                    │
                    └─► Mountains are FOR descending
                        Glory is FOR serving
                        Experiences are FOR equipping
                        │
                        └─► Can't live on mountaintop
                            Must return to valley
                            Where demons still need casting out
                            Where people still need serving
```

The Transfiguration wasn't meant to be permanent residence. It was:
- Confirmation of identity
- Preview of glory to come
- Fuel for the suffering ahead

**Application:** Stop trying to preserve spiritual highs. Let them fuel the lows. Mountain experiences equip for valley ministry.

### The Faith Connection Problem

"Little faith" vs "mustard seed faith" troubled me until I saw it:

```
THE DISTINCTION:
    │
    ├─ LITTLE FAITH (ὀλιγοπιστία):
    │   └─► Faith present but...
    │       │
    │       ├─ Wavering
    │       ├─ Divided attention
    │       ├─ Doubt mixed in
    │       └─► Weak connection
    │
    └─► MUSTARD SEED FAITH:
        └─► Tiny but...
            │
            ├─ Genuine
            ├─ Focused
            ├─ Trusting completely
            └─► Strong connection
```

It's not about faith SIZE. It's about faith CONNECTION.

Small faith fully connected to God = unlimited power.
Large faith poorly connected = failure.

**Application:** Stop trying to generate more faith. Start strengthening the connection. Quality > quantity. Focus > volume.

### The Sons Are Free Principle

This is the pattern I keep missing:

```
FREEDOM IN CHRIST:
    │
    └─► I AM free (identity in Christ)
        │
        └─► But freedom isn't:
            │
            ├─ Demanding all my rights
            ├─ Asserting my liberties
            └─► Making others accommodate me
                │
                └─► Freedom IS:
                    │
                    ├─ Ability to NOT demand
                    ├─ Choosing to defer
                    └─► Serving mission over self
```

Jesus was exempt from temple tax. He paid it anyway.

Why? "So that we may not cause offense."

**The calculus:**
- Assert right = stumble others + create conflict
- Defer right = serve others + advance mission

Sons are free to choose service.

**Application:** Where am I demanding rights that are technically mine but strategically costly? Where is assertion hurting mission?

### Grief That Misses Resurrection

The disciples heard "killed" and grieved. They missed "raised on the third day."

```
MY PATTERN:
    │
    └─► Hear bad news → focus on loss
        │
        └─► Miss the "but God" that follows
            │
            ├─ "You'll face suffering" → panic
            │   └─► Miss: "but I've overcome the world"
            │
            ├─ "This will be hard" → despair
            │   └─► Miss: "but my grace is sufficient"
            │
            └─► "You'll die" → grief
                └─► Miss: "but you'll rise"
```

The disciples were so locked on "killed" they couldn't hear "raised."

**Application:** When I hear hard words from God, wait for the full sentence. The comma before "but" isn't the period.

### Summary

Four lessons from one chapter:

1. **Mountaintops are temporary** — Don't build shelters. Gather fuel and descend.

2. **Faith is connection quality** — Small but connected beats large but wavering.

3. **Freedom serves** — Sons are free. Free to serve, not just to demand.

4. **Hear the whole sentence** — "Killed" isn't the end. "Raised" follows.

This chapter moves from glory to failure to suffering to freedom. That's the Christian life in miniature.

The mountain was real. The valley is real too. The coin in the fish's mouth proves: God provides for His children, even for obligations we don't technically owe.

He's got this.
