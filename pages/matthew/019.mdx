## The Three Movements

| Section | Focus | Core Principle |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Marriage & Celibacy** (vv. 1-12) | Covenant permanence | Creation design overrides cultural convenience |
| **Children & Ruler** (vv. 13-22) | Kingdom entry | Receive like child vs. clutch like owner |
| **Riches & Rewards** (vv. 23-30) | Cost & return | Impossible for man, possible with God; leave all, gain more |

## Section Analysis

### 1. Marriage & Divorce (vv. 1-12) — CREATION DESIGN VS. HARDENED HEARTS

```
THE SETTING (vv. 1-2)
    │
    └─► "When Jesus had finished saying these things,
         he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea
         to the other side of the Jordan"
        │
        └─► Geographical shift:
            │
            ├─ Galilee → Judea (south)
            ├─ "Other side of Jordan" = Perea
            │   └─► Herod Antipas' territory
            │       │
            │       └─► SIGNIFICANT: This is where
            │           John the Baptist confronted Herod
            │           About unlawful marriage (14:3-4)
            │           And was beheaded
            │

                    Healing validates teaching

THE TEST (v. 3)
    │
    └─► "Some Pharisees came to him to TEST him.
         They asked, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce
         his wife for ANY AND EVERY REASON?'"
        │
        └─► πειράζοντες (peirazontes) — "testing, tempting"
            │
            └─► Not sincere question
                TRAP
                │
                └─► Why a trap?
                    │
                    ├─ POLITICAL: Herod Antipas divorced wife
                    │   for Herodias (brother's wife)
                    │   John the Baptist condemned it → killed
                    │   │
                    │   └─► Get Jesus to condemn → same fate?
                    │
                    └─► THEOLOGICAL: Two rabbinic schools
                        │
                        ├─ School of SHAMMAI:
                        │   └─► Divorce ONLY for adultery
                        │       Strict interpretation of Deut 24:1
                        │       "Something indecent" = sexual sin
                        │
                        └─► School of HILLEL:
                            └─► Divorce for ANY reason
                                "Something indecent" = ANYTHING
                                │
                                └─► Burned dinner? Divorce.
                                    Spoke to another man? Divorce.
                                    Found someone prettier? Divorce.
                                    │
                                    └─► "Any and every reason"
                                        = Hillel's position

THE QUESTION'S ASSUMPTION:
    │
    └─► "Is it LAWFUL?" (ἔξεστιν)
        │
        └─► Permission-seeking
            │
            └─► Assumes: Divorce is sometimes permitted
                Question: How broad is the permission?
                │
                └─► Jesus will REFRAME entirely
```

**Jesus' Response — Back to Creation (vv. 4-6):**

```
THE COUNTER-QUESTION (v. 4)
    │
    └─► "'Haven't you READ,' he replied,
         'that at the beginning the Creator
         made them MALE and FEMALE?'"
        │
        └─► "Haven't you read?" (οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε)
            │
            └─► Sharp rebuke to Pharisees
                │
                └─► "You experts in Scripture...
                     haven't you READ?"
                    │
                    └─► Points to GENESIS, not Deuteronomy
                        │
                        └─► They want to debate Moses' exception
                            Jesus goes to God's DESIGN
                            │
                            └─► Gen 1:27: "Male and female he created them"
                                │
                                └─► Two sexes
                                    Complementary
                                    For union

THE DESIGN STATED (v. 5)
    │
    └─► "and said, 'For this reason a man will
         LEAVE his father and mother
         and be UNITED to his wife,
         and the two will become ONE FLESH'?"
        │
        └─► Quoting Gen 2:24
            │
            └─► Three movements:
                │
                ├─ LEAVE (καταλείψει)
                │   └─► Separation from origin family
                │       New primary loyalty
                │       Marriage > parents
                │
                ├─ UNITE (κολληθήσεται)
                │   └─► "Cleave, be glued to"
                │       Permanent attachment
                │       Not temporary arrangement
                │
                └─► ONE FLESH (σὰρξ μία)
                    │
                    └─► Not just physical union
                        │
                        └─► Complete merger:
                            │
                            ├─ Two become one unit
                            ├─ Identity fusion
                            ├─ Covenant oneness
                            └─► Indivisible bond

THE CONCLUSION (v. 6)
    │
    └─► "So they are NO LONGER TWO, but ONE flesh.
         Therefore what GOD has joined together,
         let no one SEPARATE"
        │
        └─► οὐκέτι εἰσὶν δύο ἀλλὰ σὰρξ μία
            "No longer are they two but flesh one"
            │
            └─► Math: 1 + 1 = 1 (not 2)
                │
                └─► Marriage creates new entity
                    │
                    └─► "What GOD has joined" (ὁ θεὸς συνέζευξεν)
                        │
                        └─► God is the JOINER
                            Not just human contract
                            DIVINE action
                            │
                            └─► "Let no one SEPARATE" (μὴ χωριζέτω)
                                │
                                └─► χωρίζω — "to divide, put apart"
                                    │
                                    └─► Divorce = SEPARATING
                                        what God JOINED
                                        │
                                        └─► Working AGAINST God

THE PRINCIPLE:
    │
    └─► CREATION DESIGN > CULTURAL PRACTICE
        │
        ├─ God's original intent: permanent union
        │
        └─► Human exceptions: concessions to sin
            │
            └─► Jesus restores original standard
```

**The Moses Question (vv. 7-9):**

```
THE PHARISEES' CHALLENGE (v. 7)
    │
    └─► "'Why then,' they asked,
         'did Moses COMMAND that a man give his wife
         a certificate of divorce and send her away?'"
        │
        └─► They cite Deut 24:1-4
            │
            └─► BUT notice their framing:
                │
                └─► "Moses COMMANDED" (ἐνετείλατο)
                    │
                    └─► They present it as COMMAND
                        As if Moses REQUIRED divorce
                        │
                        └─► Misrepresentation

JESUS' CORRECTION (v. 8)
    │
    └─► "Jesus replied, 'Moses PERMITTED you
         to divorce your wives because
         your hearts were HARD.
         But it was NOT THIS WAY from the beginning'"
        │
        └─► Key distinctions:
            │
            ├─ "PERMITTED" (ἐπέτρεψεν) not "commanded"
            │   │
            │   └─► Huge difference:
            │       │
            │       ├─ Command = God's will
            │       │
            │       └─► Permission = concession to sin
            │           │
            │           └─► Like speed limits after reckless driving
            │               Not endorsement, damage control
            │
            ├─ "Because hearts were HARD" (σκληροκαρδίαν)
            │   │
            │   └─► σκληρός (hard) + καρδία (heart)
            │       │
            │       └─► Not God's ideal
            │           Human failure required regulation
            │           │
            │           └─► Without divorce law:
            │               ├─ Abandoned wives had no protection
            │               ├─ No documentation of status
            │               └─► Certificate gave legal standing
            │                   To remarry, live independently
            │
            └─► "NOT THIS WAY from beginning"
                │
                └─► οὐκ γέγονεν οὕτως (not has it been so)
                    │
                    └─► Perfect tense: has never been God's design
                        │
                        └─► Eden had NO divorce
                            │
                            └─► Sin introduced hardness
                                Hardness required concession
                                But original design = permanent

THE CLARIFICATION (v. 9)
    │
    └─► "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife,
         EXCEPT FOR SEXUAL IMMORALITY,
         and marries another woman commits ADULTERY"
        │
        └─► μὴ ἐπὶ πορνείᾳ — "except for fornication"
            │
            └─► THE EXCEPTION CLAUSE:
                │
                ├─ πορνεία (porneia)
                │   │

                └─► Exception exists
                    But it's exception, not loophole
