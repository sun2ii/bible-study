# Matthew 1 - The King's Lineage

> The genealogy's structure reveals God's sovereignty over history. Three sets of 14 generations—not accident but architecture. God orchestrated kings, exiles, and obscure names across 2,000 years to produce one Child. Matthew shows that Jesus' arrival wasn't plan B; it was the plan all along, written into the bloodline of humanity.

### Why 14? Hebrew Gematria

**"David" in Hebrew = דוד**

```
דוד (read right to left: D-V-D)
│││
││└─ ד (Dalet) = 4
│└── ו (Vav)   = 6
└─── ד (Dalet) = 4
                ───
                 14
```

**Matthew structured his genealogy in 14s to declare:**
**"DAVID! DAVID! DAVID! - This Jesus is the promised King!"**

## The Women (Grace Breaking In)

| Woman | Background | Story |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Tamar** | Canaanite | Desperate measures, vindicated (Gen 38) |
| **Rahab** | Canaanite prostitute | Faith saved her family (Josh 2) |
| **Ruth** | Moabite foreigner | Loyalty and redemption (Book of Ruth) |
| **Bathsheba** | "Uriah's wife" | Emphasizes David's sin (2 Sam 11) |
| **Mary** | Virgin | "mother of Jesus" - no father listed |

### One-Line Cut
**The Messiah's bloodline includes outsiders, scandals, and broken kings - grace was always the plan.**

---

## Two Names, One Identity

| Name | Meaning | Emphasis |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Jesus** | "YHWH saves" | What He does - saves from sins |
| **Immanuel** | "God with us" | Who He is - God incarnate |

### One-Line Cut
**Joseph's "yes" gave Jesus His legal right to David's throne - adoption completes what blood cannot.**
