MATTHEW 25 STRUCTURE
    │
    ├─ vv. 1-13   TEN VIRGINS → Readiness during delay
    │   ├─► Ten virgins wait for bridegroom
    │   ├─► Five wise: brought extra oil
    │   ├─► Five foolish: lamps only, no reserve
    │   └─► Bridegroom delayed → all slept
    │       Midnight cry → lamps trimmed
    │       Foolish: "Give us your oil"
    │       Wise: "No, buy your own"
    │       │
    │       └─► Door shut. "I don't know you."
    │           │
    │           WATCH — YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN
    │
    ├─ vv. 14-30  BAGS OF GOLD → Action during absence
    │   ├─► Master distributes: 5, 2, 1 bags
    │   ├─► First two: invested, doubled
    │   ├─► Third: buried it (fear)
    │   └─► Master returns, settles accounts
    │       Two faithful → "Share my happiness"
    │       One fearful → "Wicked, lazy"
    │       │
    │       └─► Thrown into darkness
    │           │
    │           ACT — YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN

    └─ vv. 31-46  SHEEP & GOATS → Evidence of life
        ├─► Son of Man on throne
        ├─► All nations gathered
        ├─► Separation: right (sheep) / left (goats)
        └─► Criterion: treatment of "least of these"
            │
            ├─ Sheep: Fed, clothed, visited
            │   "When did we see you?"
            │   "When you did it to LEAST"
            │
            └─► Goats: Did NOT feed, clothe, visit
                "When did we NOT see you?"
                "When you did NOT do it to LEAST"
                │
                └─► Eternal punishment / Eternal life
                    │
                    LOVE — IT WAS ALWAYS HIM
```

## The Invariant Pattern

```
ALL THREE PARABLES: SAME ENGINE
    │
    ├─ ABSENCE
    │   ├─ Bridegroom delayed
    │   ├─ Master "on journey"
    │   └─► Son of Man not yet "come in glory"
    │
    ├─ TWO GROUPS
    │   ├─ Wise / Foolish virgins
    │   ├─ Faithful / Wicked servants
    │   └─► Sheep / Goats
    │
    ├─ WHAT THEY DID DURING ABSENCE
    │   ├─ Oil prepared / not prepared
    │   ├─ Invested / buried
    │   └─► Compassion shown / withheld
    │
    ├─ RETURN (sudden, unexpected)
    │   ├─ "At midnight the cry rang out"
    │   ├─ "After a long time the master returned"
    │   └─► "When the Son of Man comes in glory"
    │
    ├─ SEPARATION (decisive, irreversible)
    │   ├─ Door shut
    │   ├─ Cast into darkness
    │   └─► Left into eternal fire
    │
    └─► REVELATION: Actions reveal reality
        │
        ├─ You can't borrow readiness
        ├─ You can't hide from accountability
        └─► You can't claim ignorance of need
```

```
THE FAILURE MODES
    │
    ├─ VIRGINS: Borrowed relationship
    │   └─► "Give us your oil"
    │       │
    │       ├─ Oil = personal preparation
    │       ├─ Can't be transferred
    │       └─► Faith is non-negotiable
    │           │
    │           You can't ride on someone else's
    │
    ├─ SERVANT: Fear-based inaction
    │   └─► "I knew you were hard"
    │       │
    │       ├─ Wrong view of master
    │       ├─ Fear paralyzed action
    │       └─► Preserved = wasted
    │           │
    │           Safety is not faithfulness
    │
    └─► GOATS: Invisible Christ
        └─► "When did we see YOU?"
            │
            ├─ Saw need, didn't see Christ
            ├─ Would have helped Jesus
            └─► Didn't help "least of these"
                │
                Christ hidden in the vulnerable
```

## Section Analysis

### 1. Ten Virgins (vv. 1-13) — READINESS

```
THE SETUP (vv. 1-4)
    │
    └─► "At that time the kingdom of heaven
         will be LIKE ten virgins..."
        │
        ├─ Context: "At that time"
        │   └─► Connected to Ch 24
        │       │
        │       └─► Second coming discourse
        │           "No one knows the day or hour" (24:36)
        │           "Keep watch" (24:42)
        │           │
        │           This parable illustrates HOW to watch
        │
        └─► Wedding custom:
            │
            └─► Bridesmaids wait at bride's house
                Bridegroom comes at night
                Procession to wedding feast
                │
                Lamps required for entry
                No lamp = no entry

TEN VIRGINS (v. 1)
    │
    ├─ ALL ten:
    │   ├─ Had lamps
    │   ├─ Went out to meet bridegroom
    │   └─► Looked identical externally
    │
    └─► FIVE/FIVE split:
        │
        ├─ μωραί (mōrai) — "foolish"
        │   └─► Root of "moron"
        │       Lamps ONLY
        │       No reserve oil
        │
        └─► φρόνιμοι (phronimoi) — "wise"
            └─► Same word as "wise builder" (7:24)
                Lamps + OIL IN JARS
                Prepared for delay

THE DISTINCTION (vv. 3-4)
    │
    └─► "The foolish ones took their lamps
         but did not take any oil with them.
         The wise ones, however, took oil
         in jars along with their lamps."
        │
        └─► The difference:
            │
            ├─ NOT: lamps vs no lamps
            │   (Both had lamps)
            │
            ├─ NOT: oil vs no oil
            │   (Both had some oil)
            │
            └─► IS: RESERVE for extended wait
                │
                └─► Wise anticipated delay
                    Foolish assumed quick arrival
                    │
                    → What do you do when
                      the wait gets long?
```

```
THE DELAY (v. 5)
    │
    └─► "The bridegroom was a LONG TIME in coming,
         and they all became drowsy and fell asleep."
        │
        ├─ χρονίζοντος (chronizontos)
        │   └─► "Delayed, took a long time"
        │       From χρόνος (chronos) — "time"
        │       │
        │       The bridegroom DELAYS
        │       This is expected, not failure
        │
        └─► ALL TEN slept
            │
            ├─ Wise and foolish
            ├─ Both drowsy
            └─► Both asleep
                │
                → Sleeping NOT the problem
                  Unpreparedness is the problem
                  │
                  You can rest if you're ready
                  You can't rest INTO readiness

THE CRISIS (vv. 6-9)
    │
    └─► "At midnight the cry rang out:
         'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'"
        │
        ├─ MIDNIGHT
        │   └─► Darkest hour
        │       Least expected
        │       No warning
        │
        └─► "All the virgins woke up
             and trimmed their lamps"
            │
            ├─ κόσμησαν (kosmēsan) — "trimmed, arranged"
            │   └─► Adjusted wicks
            │       Checked oil level
            │       Prepared for use
            │
            └─► CRISIS REVEALED:
                │
                "The foolish ones said to the wise,
                 'Give us some of your oil;
                  our lamps are going out.'"
                │
                └─► σβέννυνται (sbennyntai)
                    │
                    └─► "Being extinguished, going out"
                        │
                        Had some oil
                        Enough to START
                        Not enough to LAST
                        │
                        → Initial flame ≠ sustained light

THE REQUEST (vv. 8-9)
    │
    └─► "Give us some of YOUR oil"
        │
        └─► The assumption:
            │
            ├─ Oil is transferable
            ├─ Relationship can be borrowed
            └─► Last-minute acquisition possible
                │
                THE ANSWER: "No"
                │
                └─► "'No,' they replied,
                     'there may not be enough
                      for both us and you.
                      Instead, go to those who sell oil
                      and buy some for yourselves.'"
                    │
                    ├─ NOT selfishness
                    │   └─► μήποτε (mēpote) — "lest perhaps"
                    │       "There might not be enough"
                    │       │
                    │       Sharing would doom both
                    │       No one gets in
                    │
                    └─► Oil represents:
                        │
                        ├─ Personal relationship with God
                        ├─ Genuine faith
                        ├─ Holy Spirit
                        └─► Inner preparation
                            │
                            → Cannot be borrowed
                              Cannot be transferred
                              Cannot be faked at last minute
```

```
THE EXCLUSION (vv. 10-12)
    │
    └─► "But while they were on their way to buy the oil,
         the bridegroom arrived.
         The virgins who were READY went in with him
         to the wedding banquet.
         And the DOOR WAS SHUT."
        │
        ├─ READY (ἕτοιμοι, hetoimoi)
        │   └─► Same word: "everything is ready" (22:4)
        │       │
        │       Ready = prepared beforehand
        │       Not: scrambling at last moment
        │
        ├─ "Went in WITH him"
        │   └─► μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ (met' autou)
        │       │
        │       Relationship word
        │       Not just location
        │       │
        │       → In = WITH the bridegroom
        │         Out = WITHOUT the bridegroom
        │
        └─► "THE DOOR WAS SHUT"
            │
            ἐκλείσθη (ekleisthē) — aorist passive
            │
            └─► Single decisive action
                Door shut BY someone
                (by the bridegroom/master)
                │
                → Finality
                  No re-opening
                  Opportunity closed

"LATER THE OTHERS ALSO CAME" (vv. 11-12)
    │
    └─► "'Lord, Lord,' they said,
         'open the door for us!'
         But he replied,
         'Truly I tell you, I don't know you.'"
        │
        ├─ "Lord, Lord"
        │   └─► Same words as 7:21-23
        │       │
        │       "Not everyone who says to me
        │        'Lord, Lord' will enter...
        │        'I never knew you'"
        │       │
        │       Verbal acknowledgment ≠ relationship
        │
        └─► "I don't know you"
            │
            οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς
            │
            └─► NOT: "I forgot you"
                NOT: "I don't recognize you"
                IS: "We have no relationship"
                │
                → Knowledge = covenant intimacy
                  "Not knowing" = no bond exists
```

```
THE LESSON (v. 13)
    │
    └─► "Therefore keep watch,
         because you do not know
         the day or the hour."
        │
        ├─ γρηγορεῖτε (grēgoreite)
        │   └─► "Keep watching, stay awake"
        │       Present imperative: continuous
        │       │
        │       NOT: one-time action
        │       IS: lifestyle of readiness
        │
        └─► The irony:
            │
            ALL TEN SLEPT (v. 5)
            │
            └─► Yet told to "watch"
                │
                → "Watching" ≠ not sleeping
                  "Watching" = being prepared
                  │
                  You can sleep and be ready
                  You can be awake and unready
```

### 2. Bags of Gold (vv. 14-30) — STEWARDSHIP

```
THE SETUP (vv. 14-15)
    │
    └─► "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey,
         who called his servants
         and entrusted his wealth to them.
         To one he gave five bags of gold,
         to another two bags,
         and to another one bag,
         each according to his ability.
         Then he went on his journey."
        │
        ├─ "AGAIN, it will be like..."
        │   └─► Continues same theme
        │       Second illustration of kingdom waiting
        │
        ├─ τάλαντα (talanta) — "talents"
        │   └─► NOT "bags of gold" (NIV interpretation)
        │       │
        │       1 talent = 6,000 denarii
        │       1 denarius = day's wage
        │       1 talent = ~20 YEARS wages
        │       │
        │       5 talents = 100 years wages
        │       2 talents = 40 years wages
        │       1 talent = 20 years wages
        │       │
        │       → Even ONE talent is massive wealth
        │         No servant received "little"
        │
        └─► "Each according to his ability"
            │
            κατὰ τὴν ἰδίαν δύναμιν
            │
            └─► Custom allocation
                Master knows each servant
                Different capacity, different trust
                │
                → Unequal distribution is just
                  Expectation matches ability
                  No one gets more than they can handle

THE ACTION (vv. 16-18)
    │
    ├─ FIVE-TALENT SERVANT (v. 16)
    │   └─► "Went at once and put his money to work
    │        and gained five bags more"
    │       │
    │       ├─ εὐθέως (eutheōs) — "immediately"
    │       │   └─► No delay
    │       │       Didn't wait for instructions
    │       │       Understood the assignment
    │       │
    │       ├─ ἠργάσατο (ērgasato) — "worked, traded"
    │       │   └─► Put money to WORK
    │       │       Active investment
    │       │       Risk required
    │       │
    │       └─► RESULT: 100% return
    │           5 → 10
    │

        │       │   ├─ Option 2: Disciples specifically
        │       │   └─► Option 3: Both (disciples = representative)
        │       │
        │       └─► "LEAST" (ἐλάχιστος)
        │           │
        │           Superlative of "small"
        │           Smallest, lowest, most insignificant
        │           │
        │           → Society's throwaway people
        │             The ones easily ignored
        │
        └─► "YOU DID FOR ME"
            │
            ἐμοὶ ἐποιήσατε
            │
            └─► Christ identifies with the vulnerable
                │
                NOT: "as if to me"
                IS: "to ME"
                │
                Ontological identification
                Christ present in the least
                │
                → Every encounter with need
                  is encounter with Christ
                  (whether recognized or not)
```

```
THE CURSE (vv. 41-45)
    │
    └─► "Then he will say to those on his left,
         'Depart from me, you who are CURSED,
          into the eternal fire
          PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS.'"
        │
        ├─ CONTRAST:
        │   │
        │   ├─ Blessed → "Come"
        │   │   Cursed → "Depart"
        │   │
        │   ├─ Kingdom "prepared for YOU"
        │   │   Fire "prepared for DEVIL"
        │   │
        │   └─► → Hell not prepared for humans
        │         Humans choose devil's destination
        │         Not God's intent for humanity
        │
        └─► SAME SIX CATEGORIES, INVERTED (vv. 42-43)
            │
            "I was hungry → you gave me NOTHING
             I was thirsty → you gave me NOTHING
             I was a stranger → you did NOT invite
             I needed clothes → you did NOT clothe
             I was sick and in prison → you did NOT look after"
            │
            └─► NOT: active cruelty
                IS: passive neglect
                │
                → Sins of OMISSION
                  What you DIDN'T do
                  │
                  No violence required for condemnation
                  Indifference is enough

GOATS' SURPRISE (vv. 44)
    │
    └─► "They also will answer,
         'Lord, when did we see you
          hungry or thirsty or a stranger
          or needing clothes or sick or in prison,
          and did NOT help you?'"
        │
        └─► SAME surprise as sheep
            │
            "When did we see YOU?"
            │
            ├─ They also didn't see Christ in the needy
            ├─ But their response was: nothing
            └─► They saw NEED, didn't see CHRIST
                │
                → The sheep also didn't see Christ
                  But they responded to NEED anyway
                  │
                  Difference: response to need itself
                  Not: ability to spot Jesus

THE VERDICT (vv. 45-46)
    │
    └─► "'Truly I tell you,
          whatever you did NOT do
          for one of the least of these,
          you did NOT do for me.'
         Then they will go away to eternal punishment,
         but the righteous to eternal life."
        │
        ├─ PARALLEL STRUCTURE:
        │   │
        │   Did → did for me → eternal life
        │   Did NOT → did NOT for me → eternal punishment
        │
        └─► κόλασιν αἰώνιον / ζωὴν αἰώνιον
            │
            "Eternal punishment" / "Eternal life"
            │
            Same adjective (αἰώνιος) for both
            │
            → Same duration
              Same finality
              Both permanent
```

## The Deep Structure

```
THE THREE TESTS — WHAT'S REALLY BEING MEASURED
    │
    ├─ VIRGINS: Personal relationship
    │   │
    │   └─► Can you borrow someone else's faith?
    │       │
    │       NO.
    │       │
    │       Oil = internal, personal, non-transferable
    │       Lamps = external, visible, shareable
    │       │
    │       → You can share religion
    │         You cannot share relationship
    │
    ├─ TALENTS: Productive action
    │   │
    │   └─► Is safety the same as faithfulness?
    │       │
    │       NO.
    │       │
    │       Preservation = wicked
    │       Production = faithful
    │       │
    │       → Fear is not neutral
    │         Inaction is not safe
    │         Return unchanged = failure
    │
    └─► SHEEP/GOATS: Reflexive compassion
        │
        └─► Can you help Christ without helping people?
            │
            NO.
            │
            Christ hidden in the vulnerable
            Service to least = service to King
            │
            → You cannot love God abstractly
              Love manifests in tangible action
              Indifference to need = rejection of Christ

THE COMMON THREAD:
    │
    └─► All three parables ask:
        │
        "WHAT DID YOU DO DURING THE DELAY?"
        │
        ├─ Virgins: Did you prepare for extended wait?
        ├─ Servants: Did you work while master was away?
        └─► Nations: Did you serve the vulnerable?
            │
            THE ABSENCE IS THE TEST
            │
            What you do when the King isn't visible
            reveals who you really are
```

```
THE WARNING ABOUT SURPRISE
    │
    ├─ FOOLISH VIRGINS surprised:
    │   └─► "We THOUGHT we were ready"
    │       Had lamps, went out, waited
    │       Looked identical to wise
    │       │
    │       But: no reserve
    │
    ├─ WICKED SERVANT surprised:
    │   └─► "I THOUGHT I was being safe"
    │       Returned exact amount
    │       Didn't lose anything
    │       │
    │       But: no gain
    │
    └─► GOATS surprised:
        └─► "We THOUGHT we would have noticed YOU"
            Would have helped Jesus himself
            Didn't realize need = Jesus
            │
            But: didn't respond to need

    → SELF-ASSESSMENT IS UNRELIABLE
      │
      All three groups thought they were fine
      All three groups were wrong
      │
      The test is not: "Do you think you're ready?"
      The test is: "What did you actually do?"
```

---

## Diagnostic Summary

```
READINESS DIAGNOSTIC (Virgins)
    │
    ├─ Do I have personal relationship, or borrowed religion?
    ├─ Am I prepared for delay, or assuming quick arrival?
    ├─ Is my faith sustainable, or just initial enthusiasm?
    └─► Can I wait indefinitely and still be ready?

STEWARDSHIP DIAGNOSTIC (Talents)
    │
    ├─ Am I using what I've been given?
    ├─ Am I taking appropriate risks for master's benefit?
    ├─ Do I view God as harsh, or as generous?
    └─► Is fear driving my inaction?

COMPASSION DIAGNOSTIC (Sheep/Goats)
    │
    ├─ Do I respond to need, even without recognizing Christ?
    ├─ Is my compassion reflexive or calculated?
    ├─ Do I see the "least" as worthy of my attention?
    └─► What am I NOT doing?
```

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Three parables reveal the same truth: the King's return will separate those who prepared personally, invested actively, and loved reflexively from those who borrowed, buried, and ignored.**
