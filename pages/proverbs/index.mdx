## Two Paths, One Choice

```
THE FUNDAMENTAL DECISION
    │
    ├─ WISDOM (חָכְמָה / chokmah)
    │   ├─ Personified as a woman calling in the streets
    │   ├─ Leads to: life, honor, riches, peace
    │   ├─ Source: Fear of the Lord
    │   └─► "She is a tree of life" (3:18)
    │
    └─ FOLLY (אִוֶּלֶת / ivveleth)
        ├─ Also personified as a woman calling
        ├─ Leads to: death, shame, poverty, chaos
        ├─ Source: Rejecting God's order
        └─► "Her house leads down to death" (9:18)
```

| Wisdom | Folly |
|--------|-------|
| Accepts correction | Hates rebuke |
| Plans ahead | Lives for now |
| Controls tongue | Speaks rashly |
| Works diligently | Loves sleep |
| Fears the Lord | Trusts self |

---

## The Fear of the Lord

```
THE FOUNDATION (1:7)
    │
    └─► "The FEAR of the LORD
         is the BEGINNING of knowledge"
            │
            ├─ Not terror → reverent awe
            ├─ Not start → foundation/essence
            │
            └─► Without this, wisdom is just cleverness
                With this, wisdom becomes life
```

**One-liner:** Wisdom isn't IQ - it's knowing who's actually in charge.

## How to Read Proverbs

```
READING STRATEGY
    │
    ├─ DAILY: Read chapter matching date
    │   └─► Dec 12 = Proverbs 12
    │
    ├─ DON'T: Read like promises
    │   └─► These are principles, not guarantees
    │       "Train up a child..." = generally true
    │       Not: "This formula always works"
    │
    └─ DO: Let each proverb examine you
        │
        └─► "A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,
             but only in expressing his opinion" (18:2)
            │
            └─► Ouch. That's me in meetings.
```

## Why This Book

> "Getting wisdom is the wisest thing you can do!
> And whatever else you do, develop good judgment." (4:7 NLT)

Proverbs isn't philosophy. It's **skill for living** - the accumulated observations of those who watched how God's world actually works.

Matthew shows you the King.
Proverbs teaches you to walk in His kingdom.
