## Why This Book

> "The Psalms are a little Bible... a summary of the Old Testament arranged for prayer." — Martin Luther

The Psalms give you words when you have none. They teach you how to be honest with God—in grief, in joy, in anger, in awe.

Matthew shows you the King.
Proverbs teaches you to walk wisely.
**Psalms teaches you to pray.**
