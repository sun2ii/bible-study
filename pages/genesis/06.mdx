# Genesis 6: Wickedness, Judgment & One Righteous Man

> Genesis 5 ended with Noah, named for "comfort" from the curse. Genesis 6 reveals why that comfort was needed: humanity had become utterly corrupt, every inclination of their hearts only evil continually. Yet in the midst of global wickedness, one man "found favor"—Noah, who walked with God. This chapter sets up the flood narrative by establishing both the depth of human depravity and God's provision of grace through a remnant.

## The Three Movements

| Section | Focus | Core Reality |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **The Corruption** (vv. 1-7) | Humanity's evil | Every inclination only evil → God regrets, resolves judgment |
| **The Exception** (vv. 8-10) | Noah's righteousness | One man finds favor, walks with God |
| **The Provision** (vv. 11-22) | Ark instructions | God provides way of escape → Noah obeys exactly |

## The Judgment Architecture

```
CHAPTER 5 ENDED:
    │
    └─► NOAH INTRODUCED (5:28-32)
        │
        └─► Lamech prophesies: "comfort from toil"
            Noah born
            Has three sons
            │
            CHAPTER 6 OPENS:
            │
            └─► EXPLAINING WHY COMFORT NEEDED
                │
                ├─ Corruption spreads
                ├─ Violence fills earth
                └─► God resolves judgment
                    │
                    BUT:
                    │
                    └─► Noah finds favor
                        Provides way of escape

THE ESCALATION PATTERN:
    │
    ├─ Gen 3: One sin (eating fruit)
    │   └─► Result: Expelled from garden
    │
    ├─ Gen 4: One murder (Cain kills Abel)
    │   └─► Result: Marked, exiled
    │
    ├─ Gen 4: Violence amplified (Lamech's boast)
    │   └─► Result: Civilization without God
    │
    └─► Gen 6: UNIVERSAL corruption
        │
        └─► "Every inclination... only evil ALL the time"
            │
            Result: GLOBAL judgment
            │
            → Sin's progression:
              Personal → familial → cultural → global
              │
              Judgment's progression:
              Exile → marking → warning → flood

THE CONTRAST:
    │
    ├─ HUMANITY (vv. 5-7, 11-13)
    │   │
    │   ├─ Wickedness GREAT
    │   ├─ Every thought ONLY evil
    │   ├─ Earth CORRUPT
    │   └─► Full of VIOLENCE
    │       │
    │       → Total depravity
    │         Irredeemable corruption
    │
    └─► NOAH (vv. 8-10)
        │
        ├─ Found FAVOR
        ├─ RIGHTEOUS man
        ├─ BLAMELESS among his generation
        └─► WALKED with God
            │
            → Singular exception
              Grace's recipient
```

```
THE THEOLOGICAL TENSION:
    │
    ├─ GOD'S REGRET (vv. 6-7)
    │   │

    │       │
    │       ├─ Does God change His mind?
    │       │   └─► 1 Sam 15:29: "Glory of Israel does not lie
    │       │                     or change his mind"
    │       │       Num 23:19: "God is not human... that he should
    │       │                   change his mind"
    │       │       │
    │       │       → God's character unchangeable
    │       │         God's purposes immutable
    │       │
    │       └─► Then what does "regret" mean?
    │           │
    │           └─► נָחַם (nacham) — "regret, relent, be sorry"
    │               │
    │               ├─ Not: Change of plan
    │               │   └─► God knew sin would come
    │               │       Planned redemption before foundation
    │               │       │
    │               │       1 Pet 1:20: "Chosen before creation"
    │               │
    │               └─► IS: Genuine grief over sin's result
    │                   │
    │                   → Anthropopathism: human emotion attributed to God
    │                     To express His real sorrow over sin
    │                     │
    │                     "Heart was troubled" (עָצַב - atsav)
    │                     = "grieved, pained"
    │                     │
    │                     → God's holy grief
    │                       Over creation's corruption
    │
    └─► GOD'S GRACE (v. 8)
        │
        └─► "BUT Noah found favor"
            │
            ├─ וְנֹחַ מָצָא חֵן (veNoach matsa chen)
            │   "But Noah found grace"
            │   │
            │   └─► חֵן (chen) = "grace, favor"
            │       Unmerited kindness
            │       │
            │       Not: Noah earned it
            │       IS: God granted it
            │
            └─► Tension resolved:
                │
                ├─ God's justice: Must judge sin
                └─► God's mercy: Preserves remnant
                    │
                    → Both fully expressed
                      Justice in flood
                      Mercy in ark

- בְּנוֹת הָאָדָם (benot ha'adam) — "daughters of humans/Adam"
- נְפִלִים (Nephilim) — "fallen ones" or "giants"
- גִּבֹּרִים (gibborim) — "mighty men, warriors"

```
THE SETTING (vv. 1-2)
    │
    └─► "When human beings began to increase in number on the earth
         and daughters were born to them,
         the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful,
         and they married any of them they chose"

                            │

                            → Universal corruption
                              Except Noah (v. 8)

THE LORD'S GRIEF (v. 6)
    │
    └─► "The LORD REGRETTED that he had made human beings on the earth,
         and his heart was DEEPLY TROUBLED"

            │       → Lamech: Noah will "comfort us"
            │         God: "regrets" making mankind
            │         │
            │         Irony: comfort needed because of grief
            │

                    │
                    Same root: Gen 3:16-17 "painful toil"
                    │
                    → God's pain over sin
                      Deep grief
                      │
                      NOT: Regret as in "mistake"
                      IS: Sorrow over rebellion's result
                      │
                      Eph 4:30: "Do not grieve Holy Spirit"
                      Isa 63:10: "They rebelled, grieved his Holy Spirit"

THE RESOLVE (v. 7)
    │
    └─► "So the LORD said,
         'I will WIPE FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
         the human race I have created—
         and with them the animals, the birds

            │         │

            │             │

            │
            → Most important "but" in Scripture

              ├─ vv. 5-7: Universal judgment
              └─► v. 8: One exception
                  │
                  → Grace interrupts justice

"FOUND FAVOR"
    │
    └─► מָצָא חֵן (matsa chen)
        │
        ├─ "Found" (מָצָא - matsa)
        │   │
        │   └─► Not: "earned" or "deserved"
        │       IS: "found, discovered, came upon"
        │       │
        │       → Grace cannot be earned
        │         Only received

        └─► "Favor" (חֵן - chen)
            │

                Unmerited favor
                │
                → Eph 2:8-9: "By grace you have been saved,
                              through faith—
                              not of works,
                              so that no one can boast"
                │
                → Noah didn't earn it
                  God granted it

"IN THE EYES OF THE LORD"
    │
    └─► בְּעֵינֵי יְהוָה (be'einei YHWH)
        │
        → "In the eyes of" = from perspective of
          │
          Humans saw: evil all around
          God saw: ONE righteous man
          │
          → Divine perspective
            Sees what others miss
            │
            1 Sam 16:7: "LORD looks at heart"

WHY NOAH?
    │
    └─► Next verses explain (vv. 9-10)
        │
        But note:
        │
        └─► Favor PRECEDES righteousness in text
            │
            v. 8: Found favor
            v. 9: Was righteous
            │
            → Which came first?
              │
              ├─ Did God choose Noah because righteous?
              │   └─► Merit-based selection
              │
              └─► Or was Noah righteous because chosen?
                  │
                  └─► Grace-enabled righteousness
                      │
                      Both/and:
                      │
                      ├─ God's grace: unmerited
                      └─► Noah's response: obedience
                          │
                          → Grace doesn't negate responsibility
                            Responsibility doesn't negate grace

    │
    ├─ FAMILY SAVED (v. 18b)

### 7. Noah's Obedience (v. 22)

**Key Hebrew:**
- עָשָׂה (asah) — "did, made"

```
THE RESPONSE (v. 22)
    │
    └─► "Noah did EVERYTHING just as God commanded him"

        └─► וַיַּעַשׂ נֹחַ כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה אֹתוֹ אֱלֹהִים כֵּן עָשָׂה
            (vaya'as Noach kekhol asher tsivvah oto elohim ken asah)
            │
            "And Noah did according to ALL that God commanded him,
             thus he did"
            │
            → Emphatic repetition:
              │
              ├─ "Did" (עָשָׂה - asah) used TWICE
              │   → Beginning and end
              │     Bookends his obedience
              │
              ├─ "EVERYTHING" (כְּכֹל - kekhol)
              │   → "According to all"
              │     Total obedience
              │     │
              │     Nothing omitted
              │     Nothing added
              │
              └─► "Just as God commanded"
                  │
                  → Exact obedience
                    No modifications
                    No improvements
                    │
                    → Pattern for faith:
                      │
                      Heb 11:7: "By FAITH Noah... built an ark"
                      │
                      ├─ Faith hears God's word
                      ├─ Faith obeys completely
                      └─► Faith acts despite circumstances
                          │
                          → No rain yet (never rained before?)
                            Mocked by contemporaries?
                            120 years of labor
                            │
                            Yet: "Noah did everything"
                            │
                            → Faith = obedience
                              James 2:22: "Faith made complete by works"

THE SIGNIFICANCE:
    │
    └─► Contrast with:
        │
        ├─ Gen 3: Adam/Eve didn't obey one command
        │   → Judgment on humanity
        │
        └─► Gen 6: Noah obeyed all commands
            → Salvation for humanity
            │
            → One man's disobedience → death
              One man's obedience → life
              │
              Rom 5:19: "Through disobedience of one man
                         many made sinners;
                         through obedience of the one man
                         many will be made righteous"
              │
              → Noah = type of Christ
                Obedient one who saves

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Genesis 6 reveals humanity's total corruption (every inclination only evil all the time) and God's grieving resolve to judge through a flood, yet in the midst of universal wickedness one man found favor—Noah, who was righteous, blameless, and walked with God—and through his complete obedience in building the ark, God provided a way of salvation through judgment.**

## Application Questions

### Total Depravity

**The Diagnosis (v. 5):**
"Every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time."

**Questions to consider:**
- What does "every inclination" reveal about the extent of sin's reach?
- How does this assessment challenge views of human goodness or moral neutrality?
- What's the relationship between thoughts/inclinations and actions?
- How does Romans 3:10-23 parallel this diagnosis?

### Divine Grief

**The Regret (vv. 6-7):**
God "regretted" making humanity and His "heart was deeply troubled."

**Questions to consider:**
- How can God "regret" if He's unchanging and sovereign?
- What does God's grief reveal about His character?
- How does sin affect God emotionally (Eph 4:30, Isa 63:10)?
- What's the relationship between God's sorrow and His judgment?

### Finding Favor

**The Exception (v. 8):**
"But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD."

**Questions to consider:**
- What's the difference between "finding favor" and "earning salvation"?
- How does grace precede righteousness in the text (v. 8 before v. 9)?
- What's the relationship between God's favor and Noah's character?
- How does Ephesians 2:8-9 illuminate this passage?

### Walking with God

**The Character (v. 9):**
Noah was "righteous," "blameless among the people of his time," and "walked faithfully with God."

**Questions to consider:**
- What does it mean to "walk with God" in a corrupt generation?
- How can someone be "blameless" without being sinless?
- What's the relationship between being righteous before God and blameless before people?
- How does Enoch's similar description (Gen 5:22, 24) inform this?

### Complete Obedience

**The Response (v. 22):**
"Noah did everything just as God commanded him."

**Questions to consider:**
- What does "everything" reveal about the nature of faith?
- How does Noah's obedience prefigure Christ (Rom 5:19)?
- What might 120 years of ark-building require in terms of faith and endurance?
- How does James 2:22 ("faith made complete by works") relate to this?

### Chapter Synthesis

**Central Tension:**
Universal corruption vs. singular grace

**The Pattern:**
1. Humanity corrupts utterly (vv. 1-7, 11-13)
2. God grieves and resolves judgment (vv. 6-7, 13, 17)
3. Grace intervenes through one man (v. 8)
4. Faith obeys completely (v. 22)

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. How does Genesis 6:5 define "total depravity"?
2. What's the relationship between God's grief (v. 6) and God's judgment (v. 7)?
3. Why is Noah's favor mentioned before his righteousness in the text?
4. How does the ark function as both judgment (water destroys) and grace (ark saves)?
5. What does Noah's complete obedience (v. 22) teach about faith's expression?
