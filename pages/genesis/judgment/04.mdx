# Genesis 4: The First Murder and the Two Lines

> Genesis 3 recorded the Fall—humanity's rebellion against God. Genesis 4 shows what that fall produces: the first murder, the first city, the first civilization built in defiance of God. Yet woven through the violence is a thread of hope: Seth is born, and people begin to call on the name of the Lord. Two lines emerge—one moving away from God (Cain's), one moving toward Him (Seth's). The rest of Scripture tracks these two seeds.

## Section Analysis

### 1. The Two Brothers and Their Offerings (vv. 1-5)

**Key Hebrew:**
- קַיִן (Qayin) — "Cain" (sounds like "acquired")
- הֶבֶל (Hevel) — "Abel" (means "breath, vapor, vanity")
- מִנְחָה (minchah) — "offering, tribute"
- שָׁעָה (sha'ah) — "to regard, look upon with favor"

```
THE BIRTHS (vv. 1-2a)
    │
    └─► "Adam made love to his wife Eve,
         and she became pregnant and gave birth to CAIN.
         She said, 'With the help of the LORD
         I have brought forth a man.'
         Later she gave birth to his brother ABEL"
        │
        ├─ קַיִן (Qayin) — "Cain"
        │   │
        │   └─► Eve's explanation: קָנִיתִי (qaniti)
        │       "I have acquired/gotten"
        │       │
        │       └─► "With the help of the LORD"
        │           אֶת־יְהוָה (et-YHWH)
        │           │
        │           ├─ Could mean: "with the LORD's help"
        │           │
        │           └─► Could also read: "I have gotten a man—
        │               the LORD"
        │               │
        │               └─► Did Eve think this was THE SEED?
        │                   The one promised in 3:15?
        │                   │
        │                   └─► If so, bitter disappointment:
        │                       Her "acquired one" becomes a murderer
        │
        └─► הֶבֶל (Hevel) — "Abel"
            │
            └─► Means "breath, vapor, vanity"
                │
                ├─ Same word used 38x in Ecclesiastes
                │   "Vanity of vanities"
                │   "Meaningless"
                │
                └─► Abel's life: brief as breath
                    Here and then gone
                    The righteous one—murdered young
                    │
                    └─► His name prophesies his fate
```

```
THE VOCATIONS (v. 2b)
    │
    └─► "Now Abel kept FLOCKS,
         and Cain worked the SOIL"
        │
        ├─ Abel: רֹעֵה צֹאן (ro'eh tso'n) — "shepherd of flocks"
        │   │
        │   └─► The righteous are often shepherds:
        │       ├─ Abel (first)
        │       ├─ Abraham, Isaac, Jacob
        │       ├─ Moses
        │       ├─ David
        │       └─► Jesus: "The Good Shepherd"
        │
        └─► Cain: עֹבֵד אֲדָמָה (oved adamah) — "worker of ground"
            │
            └─► Same vocation as Adam (2:15, 3:23)
                │
                └─► Neither vocation is inherently sinful
                    Both are needed
                    The issue is not WHAT they did
                    But HOW they approached God
```

```
THE OFFERINGS (vv. 3-4a)
    │
    └─► "In the course of time Cain brought
         SOME of the fruits of the soil
         as an offering to the LORD.
         And Abel also brought an offering—
         FAT PORTIONS from SOME OF THE FIRSTBORN
         of his flock"
        │
        ├─ CAIN'S OFFERING:
        │   │
        │   ├─ מִפְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה (mipperi ha'adamah)
        │   │   "from fruit of the ground"
        │   │
        │   └─► Notice what's MISSING:
        │       │
        │       ├─ No "firstfruits"
        │       ├─ No "best"
        │       ├─ Just "some of the fruits"
        │       │
        │       └─► Generic offering
        │           Perfunctory
        │           Going through motions
        │
        └─► ABEL'S OFFERING:
            │
            ├─ מִבְּכֹרוֹת צֹאנוֹ (mibekhorot tso'no)
            │   "from the FIRSTBORN of his flock"
            │
            ├─ וּמֵחֶלְבֵהֶן (umechelvehen)
            │   "and from their FAT portions"
            │   │
            │   └─► The FAT was the BEST part
            │       Reserved for God in later law
            │       (Lev 3:16: "All fat is the LORD's")
            │
            └─► Abel brought:
                │
                ├─ FIRSTBORN — first and best
                ├─ FAT PORTIONS — choicest parts
                │
                └─► This is FAITH (Hebrews 11:4)
                    Bringing your best to God
                    Not leftovers
```

```
GOD'S RESPONSE (vv. 4b-5)
    │
    └─► "The LORD LOOKED WITH FAVOR on Abel
         and his offering,
         but on Cain and his offering
         he DID NOT look with favor.
         So Cain was very ANGRY,
         and his face was DOWNCAST"
        │
        ├─ שָׁעָה (sha'ah) — "to look upon, regard"
        │   │
        │   └─► God "looked" on Abel—ACCEPTANCE
        │       God did not "look" on Cain—REJECTION
        │       │
        │       └─► How did they know?
        │           │
        │           ├─ Perhaps fire from heaven (cf. Lev 9:24)
        │           ├─ Perhaps some visible sign
        │           │
        │           └─► The text doesn't say
        │               But both KNEW the verdict
        │
        ├─ WHY was Cain rejected?
        │   │
        │   ├─ NOT because grain offerings are wrong
        │   │   (Lev 2 prescribes grain offerings)
        │   │
        │   ├─ NOT because blood was required here
        │   │   (Text doesn't indicate this)
        │   │
        │   └─► The difference is in the HEART:
        │       │
        │       ├─ Abel: Faith expressing itself
        │       │   Hebrews 11:4: "By FAITH Abel
        │       │   brought God a BETTER offering"
        │       │
        │       ├─ Cain: Going through motions
        │       │   1 John 3:12: "His own actions
        │       │   were EVIL and his brother's
        │       │   were RIGHTEOUS"
        │       │
        │       └─► God looks at the HEART
        │           1 Samuel 16:7: "The LORD looks
        │           at the heart"
        │
        └─► Cain's response:
            │
            ├─ וַיִּחַר (wayyichar) — "it burned"
            │   Literally: "and it was hot to Cain"
            │   ANGER
            │
            └─► וַיִּפְּלוּ פָנָיו (wayyippelu panayw)
                "and his face fell"
                │
                └─► Shame mixed with rage
                    Rejected, but won't repent
                    Angry at God, not at self
```

**The Two Offerings:**

| Aspect | Cain | Abel |
|--------|------|------|
| Vocation | Farmer | Shepherd |
| Offering | Fruits of soil | Firstborn + fat |
| Quality | "Some" | "Firstborn" + "best" |
| Heart | Perfunctory | Faith |
| God's response | Not looked upon | Looked upon with favor |
| Result | Anger, downcast | Accepted |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I bring God my firstfruits or my leftovers? Is my worship faith-filled or perfunctory?*

**One-line:** Cain brings some fruit; Abel brings the firstborn fat—God accepts faith, not formality, and Cain burns with anger.

---

### 2. God's Warning to Cain (vv. 6-7)

**Key Hebrew:**
- שְׂאֵת (se'et) — "lifting up, acceptance"
- רֹבֵץ (rovets) — "crouching, lying in wait"
- תְּשׁוּקָה (teshuqah) — "desire" (same word as 3:16)
- מָשַׁל (mashal) — "to rule, master"

```
THE QUESTIONS (v. 6)
    │
    └─► "Then the LORD said to Cain,
         'WHY are you angry?
          WHY is your face downcast?'"
        │
        ├─ God INITIATES
        │   │
        │   └─► Just as in chapter 3:
        │       "Where are you?" (3:9)
        │       │
        │       └─► God pursues sinners
        │           Doesn't wait for them to come
        │           Approaches with questions
        │           │
        │           └─► The questions invite reflection
        │               Self-examination
        │               Repentance
        │
        └─► Two questions about Cain's RESPONSE:
            │
            ├─ Not: "Why didn't you bring better?"
            │
            └─► But: "Why are you ANGRY?"
                │
                └─► The problem isn't the past offering
                    It's the present RESPONSE
                    │
                    └─► Cain can still repent
                        The door is open
                        God is offering a way forward
```

```
THE OFFER (v. 7a)
    │
    └─► "If you DO WELL,
         will there not be LIFTING UP?"
        │
        ├─ הֲלוֹא... שְׂאֵת (halo... se'et)
        │   │
        │   └─► שְׂאֵת (se'et) has two meanings:
        │       │
        │       ├─ "Lifting up" of face
        │       │   = restoration, acceptance
        │       │   Your fallen face will be lifted
        │       │
        │       └─► "Lifting up" of offering
        │           = acceptance of sacrifice
        │           Your next offering can be accepted
        │
        └─► "If you DO WELL" (הֵיטִיב/hetiv)
            │
            └─► The path forward:
                │
                ├─ Not: bring a different KIND of offering
                │
                └─► But: bring ANY offering with right heart
                    │
                    └─► DO WELL = act rightly
                        Approach God in faith
                        Not anger, not entitlement
```

```
THE WARNING (v. 7b)
    │
    └─► "But if you do NOT do what is right,
         SIN is CROUCHING at your door;
         it DESIRES to have you,
         but you must RULE over it"
        │
        ├─ "SIN is CROUCHING"
        │   │
        │   ├─ חַטָּאת (chatta't) — "sin"
        │   │   First use of this word in Scripture
        │   │
        │   └─► רֹבֵץ (rovets) — "crouching, lying in wait"
        │       │
        │       └─► Image: predator at the door
        │           │
        │           ├─ Like a lion crouching
        │           │   Waiting to pounce
        │           │
        │           └─► Sin is PERSONIFIED:
        │               Active
        │               Aggressive
        │               Hunting
        │               │
        │               └─► cf. 1 Peter 5:8:
        │                   "Your adversary the devil
        │                    prowls around like a roaring lion
        │                    seeking someone to devour"
        │
        ├─ "It DESIRES to have you"
        │   │
        │   └─► תְּשׁוּקָתוֹ (teshuqato) — "its desire"
        │       │
        │       └─► SAME WORD as Genesis 3:16:
        │           │
        │           ├─ 3:16: "Your DESIRE will be
        │           │         for your husband"
        │           │
        │           └─► 4:7: "Sin's DESIRE is for you"
        │               │
        │               └─► The parallel is intentional:
        │                   │
        │                   ├─ In 3:16: desire to CONTROL
        │                   │   (husband should rule)
        │                   │
        │                   └─► In 4:7: sin desires to CONTROL
        │                       (Cain must rule)
        │
        └─► "But you must RULE over it"
            │
            └─► וְאַתָּה תִּמְשָׁל־בּוֹ (we'attah timshol-bo)
                │
                ├─ "But YOU—rule over it!"
                │   Emphatic: the responsibility is YOURS
                │
                └─► SAME STRUCTURE as 3:16:
                    │
                    ├─ 3:16: "He will RULE over you"

                            Cain is now commanded to do

                                └─► But Cain won't choose life
```

**The Crouching Sin:**

```
THE PROGRESSION IF CAIN DOESN'T REPENT
    │
    ├─ SIN at the door
    │   └─► Already crouching, waiting
    │
    ├─ SIN desires Cain
    │   └─► Wants to possess him
    │
    └─► IF Cain doesn't rule:
        └─► SIN will rule Cain
            │
            └─► v. 8: Murder follows
```

**Diagnostic:** *What sin is crouching at my door right now? Am I ruling it, or is it ruling me?*

**One-line:** God offers Cain a path to acceptance and warns that sin crouches at his door—he must rule it or be ruled by it.

### 3. The First Murder (v. 8)

**Key Hebrew:**
- הָרַג (harag) — "to kill, slay"
- שָׂדֶה (sadeh) — "field" (open country)

```
THE MURDER (v. 8)
    │
    └─► "Now Cain said to his brother Abel,
         'Let's go out to the FIELD.'
         While they were in the field,
         Cain ATTACKED his brother Abel
         and KILLED him"
        │
        ├─ "Cain said to his brother Abel"
        │   │
        │   └─► The Masoretic Hebrew omits what Cain said
        │       Just: "Cain said to Abel..."
        │       │
        │       └─► Ancient translations add:
        │           "Let's go out to the field"
        │           │
        │           └─► Either way: PREMEDITATION
        │               This was planned
        │               Not heat of moment
        │               │
        │               └─► Cain heard God's warning (vv. 6-7)
        │                   Then ignored it
        │                   Then acted
        │
        ├─ "In the FIELD"
        │   │
        │   └─► שָׂדֶה (sadeh) — open country
        │       │
        │       └─► Away from others
        │           Isolated
        │           Planned location
        │           │
        │           └─► Cain lured Abel out
        │               Premeditated murder
        │
        ├─ "ATTACKED" (וַיָּקָם/wayyaqom)
        │   │
        │   └─► "Rose up against"
        │       Physical assault
        │       Violent action
        │
        └─► "KILLED" (וַיַּהַרְגֵהוּ/wayyahargehu)
            │
            └─► הָרַג (harag) — to slay, murder
                │
                ├─ FIRST HUMAN DEATH in Scripture
                │
                ├─ Not natural death
                │   MURDER
                │
                ├─ Not stranger killing stranger
                │   BROTHER killing BROTHER
                │
                └─► SIN'S FRUIT:
                    │
                    ├─ Ch. 3: Sin enters
                    │   Disobedience to God
                    │
                    └─► Ch. 4: Sin produces
                        Murder of brother
                        │
                        └─► James 1:15:
                            "Sin, when it is full-grown,
                             gives birth to DEATH"
```

**The Progression of Sin:**

```
FROM GARDEN TO FIELD
    │
    ├─ CHAPTER 3:
    │   ├─ Eve SAW the fruit
    │   ├─ DESIRED wisdom
    │   ├─ TOOK fruit
    │   ├─ ATE
    │   └─► Result: Spiritual death
    │
    └─► CHAPTER 4:
        ├─ Cain SAW God's rejection
        ├─ DESIRED vengeance
        ├─ TOOK Abel to field
        ├─ KILLED
        └─► Result: Physical death
            │
            └─► Sin escalates
                Generation 1: eat forbidden fruit
                Generation 2: murder your brother
```

**Diagnostic:** *Where is unresolved anger taking me? What violence (even verbal) is sin producing in my relationships?*

**One-line:** Cain lures Abel to the field and commits humanity's first murder—brother kills brother, and death's reign begins.

### 4. Confrontation and Curse (vv. 9-12)

**Key Hebrew:**
- אַיֵּה (ayyeh) — "where?" (cf. 3:9 אַיֶּכָּה)

- צֹעֲקִים (tso'aqim) — "crying out"

                        └─► 1 John 3:12:

| Expelled from Eden | Expelled from the land |
| Death sentence (eventual) | Living death (wandering) |

**Diagnostic:** *What "blood" is crying out from my past? What do I need to confess?*

**One-line:** God asks "Where is your brother?"—Cain lies and deflects—blood cries from the ground, and Cain is cursed to wander.

  ├─ EAST OF EDEN → Adam & Eve expelled (3:24)

            (Still further east)
            │
            └─► BABYLON → Israel's exile
                 (Eastward trend = away from God)
```

**Diagnostic:** *Am I moving toward God's presence or away from it? What direction is my life heading?*

**One-line:** Cain laments his punishment (not his sin), God marks him for protection, and he settles east of Eden in the land of Wandering.

**Cain's Legacy:**

| Descendant | Contribution | Significance |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cain | First city | Civilization apart from God |
| Enoch | City named after him | Legacy through achievement |
| Lamech | Two wives | Deviation from creation order |
| Jabal | Nomadic herding | Economic development |
| Jubal | Music/instruments | Arts and culture |
| Tubal-Cain | Metalworking | Technology (tools/weapons) |

WHAT'S MISSING FROM CAIN'S LINE
    │
    └─► No mention of:
        │
        ├─ Worship
        ├─ Calling on God
        ├─ Faith
        ├─ Sacrifice
        │
        └─► Contrast with 4:26:
            "At that time people began to
             call on the name of the LORD"
            │
            └─► That happens in SETH'S line
                Not Cain's
                │
                └─► Civilization without worship
                    Achievement without God
                    Culture without covenant
```

**Diagnostic:** *Am I building my "city" (legacy, achievement) with or without God? Is my work worship or substitute for worship?*

**One-line:** Cain builds the first city; his line produces nomads, musicians, and metalworkers—civilization flourishes, but worship is absent.

          a young man for INJURING me.

                        └─► CONTRAST with Matthew 18:21-22:
                            │

                                            Grace escalates forgiveness
```

**The Escalation Pattern:**

```
VIOLENCE ESCALATES THROUGH CAIN'S LINE
    │
    ├─ GEN 4:8    Cain kills Abel (jealousy)
    │              First murder
    │              Brother kills brother
    │
    ├─ GEN 4:15   God promises 7× vengeance
    │              Divine protection/warning
    │
    └─► GEN 4:23-24  Lamech kills for a wound
                     Boasts of 77× vengeance
                     Self-appointed judge
                     │
                     └─► By generation 7:
                         Murder is CELEBRATED
                         Violence is POETRY
                         Killing is BRAGGING RIGHTS
```

**Two Songs:**

| Lamech's Song (Gen 4) | Jesus' Teaching (Matt 18) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Vengeance 77× | Forgiveness 77× |
| Self-glorification | Self-denial |
| Violence celebrated | Violence renounced |
| "I killed" | "Father, forgive them" |
| Line of Cain | Kingdom of Christ |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I keep score of wrongs done to me? Am I moving toward Lamech's vengeance or Christ's forgiveness?*

**One-line:** Lamech composes humanity's first song—a boast of murder and seventy-sevenfold vengeance, the apex of Cain's violent line.

### 8. Seth and Hope Renewed (vv. 25-26)

**Key Hebrew:**
- שֵׁת (Shet) — "Seth" (appointed, granted)
- אֱנוֹשׁ (Enosh) — "Enosh" (man, mortal, frail)
- קָרָא בְּשֵׁם יְהוָה (qara beshem YHWH) — "to call on the name of the LORD"

        │               │   Focus: MY achievement
        │               │
        │               └─► Seth (4:25): "GOD has granted"
        │                   Focus: GOD's gift
        │                   │
        │                   └─► Eve has learned:
        │                       Children are not acquisitions
        │                       They are GRANTS from God
        │
        └─► "In place of Abel"
            │
            └─► תַּחַת הֶבֶל (tachat Hevel)
                "Instead of Abel"
                │
                └─► REPLACEMENT
                    │
                    ├─ Not that Seth IS Abel
                    ├─ But the LINE continues
                    │
                    └─► The seed of the woman (3:15)
                        will come through THIS line
                        Not Cain's
                        │
                        └─► Genesis 5 will trace:
                            Adam → Seth → ... → Noah
                            │
                            └─► And eventually:
                                → Abraham → David → CHRIST
```

ENOSH AND WORSHIP (v. 26)
    │
    └─► "Seth also had a son,
         and he named him ENOSH.

GENESIS 3:15 FULFILLED IN CHAPTER 4

    │   │
    │   └─► Seth's line
    │       Enosh ("mortal")
    │       Worship of YHWH
    │       Leads to Noah, Abraham, Christ
    │
    └─► "SERPENT'S SEED" — Those who reject God
        │
        └─► Cain's line
            Lamech ("I have killed")
            Violence and pride

            │
            └─► The enmity between seeds
                continues through Scripture
```

**Two Lines Compared:**

| Cain's Line | Seth's Line |
|-------------|-------------|
| Murder | Replacement |
| City-building | Calling on God |
| Arts & technology | Worship |
| Lamech's boast | Enosh's humility |
| No worship | Begins worship |
| "I have killed" | "God has granted" |
| 77× vengeance | (Later: 77× forgiveness) |

**Diagnostic:** *Am I in the line of Cain (achieving without worshiping) or Seth (calling on the LORD)? Which direction is my family heading?*

**One-line:** Seth is born as Abel's replacement; his son Enosh marks a turning point—people begin to call on the name of the LORD.

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Genesis 4:** Cain's faithless offering is rejected while Abel's is accepted; Cain murders his brother, is cursed to wander but marked for protection, and founds a civilization of achievement without worship culminating in Lamech's violent boast—yet Seth is born, and through his son Enosh, people begin to call on the name of the LORD.

## Personal Notes

### Why Was Abel Accepted?

The text doesn't say it was because of blood sacrifice. Both grain and animal offerings were later prescribed in the Law. The difference was FAITH.

```
THE DIFFERENCE
    │
    ├─ CAIN: "some of the fruits"
    │   └─► Generic
    │       Perfunctory
    │       Going through motions
    │
    └─► ABEL: "firstborn... fat portions"
        │
        ├─ FIRSTBORN = best, first
        ├─ FAT = choicest part
        │
        └─► This is FAITH expressing itself:
            │
            ├─ Trust that God will provide more
            │   (giving the FIRST)
            │
            ├─ Honor for God's worthiness
            │   (giving the BEST)
            │
            └─► Hebrews 11:4: "By FAITH Abel
                brought a BETTER offering"
                │
                └─► The issue was the HEART
                    Not the material
```

Cain wasn't rejected because he was a farmer. He was rejected because he didn't bring faith. He brought what was convenient, not what was costly.

**Application:** What am I really giving God? The first and best? Or what's left over?

### Sin Personified

v. 7 is terrifying: "Sin is CROUCHING at your door."

```
SIN AS PREDATOR
    │
    └─► רֹבֵץ (rovets) — "crouching"
        │
        └─► Like a lion in the grass
            │
            ├─ Patient
            ├─ Waiting
            ├─ Ready to pounce
            │
            └─► And it has DESIRE:
                "It desires to have you"
                │
                └─► Sin is not passive
                    Not just "bad choices"
                    It's ACTIVE
                    HUNTING
                    │
                    └─► 1 Peter 5:8:
                        "Be sober-minded; be watchful.
                         Your adversary the devil
                         prowls around like a roaring lion,
                         seeking someone to devour."
```

But God says: "You MUST rule over it."

The Hebrew is clear: תִּמְשָׁל (timshol) — "you will rule" or "you must rule." It's possible. It's commanded. Sin can be mastered.

Cain didn't master it. He opened the door.

**Application:** Where is sin crouching at MY door right now? What anger, what jealousy, what bitterness is waiting to pounce? Am I ruling it, or is it ruling me?

### The Two Lines

This is the structural key to understanding Genesis 4-11 and indeed the whole Bible.

```
THE TWO SEEDS (from 3:15)
    │
    ├─ SERPENT'S SEED
    │   │
    │   └─► Line of CAIN
    │       │
    │       ├─ Murder
    │       ├─ Lying to God
    │       ├─ No repentance
    │       ├─ City-building apart from worship
    │       ├─ Arts and technology without God
    │       ├─ Violence celebrated (Lamech)
    │       │
    │       └─► Ends with the Flood
    │           This line is WIPED OUT
    │
    └─► WOMAN'S SEED
        │
        └─► Line of SETH
            │
            ├─ "God has GRANTED" (not "I acquired")
            ├─ Enosh: acknowledging human frailty
            ├─ Calling on the name of the LORD
            │
            └─► Continues through:
                │
                ├─ Noah (Gen 6-9)
                ├─ Shem (Gen 10-11)
                ├─ Abraham (Gen 12ff)
                ├─ David
                │
                └─► CHRIST
                    │
                    └─► The SEED who crushes
                        the serpent's head
```

Genesis 4 establishes this pattern. The rest of Scripture tracks these two lines:

- Children of God vs. children of the devil (1 John 3:10)
- Wheat and tares (Matt 13:24-30)
- Sheep and goats (Matt 25:31-46)

**Application:** Which line am I in? Am I building my Enoch (city named after my son) or calling on the name of the LORD?

### Lamech and Jesus

The seventy-seven connection is too precise to be coincidental.

```
LAMECH: VENGEANCE 77×
    │
    └─► Gen 4:24: "If Cain is avenged sevenfold,
                   then Lamech seventy-sevenfold"
        │
        └─► ESCALATED VIOLENCE
            Self-vindication
            Taking vengeance into own hands

JESUS: FORGIVENESS 77×
    │
    └─► Matt 18:21-22: "Lord, how many times
                        shall I forgive my brother?
                        Up to seven times?"
                        Jesus: "Not seven times,
                                but seventy-seven times"
        │
        └─► ESCALATED MERCY
            Self-denial
            Releasing others to God
            │
            └─► THE GOSPEL REVERSES CAIN'S LINE
                │
                ├─ Where there was murder: peace
                ├─ Where there was vengeance: forgiveness
                ├─ Where there was pride: humility
                │
                └─► Jesus UNDOES the curse of Cain
```

The kingdom of Christ is the exact opposite of Lamech's kingdom. Every time we forgive "seventy times seven," we're reversing the Cain trajectory.

**Application:** What would it look like to live 77× forgiveness instead of 77× vengeance?

---

### Summary

Genesis 4 shows sin's fruit after the Fall:
- Murder (brother kills brother)
- Lying (to God's face)
- Self-pity (without repentance)
- Civilization without worship
- Violence celebrated

But it also shows:
- God's patience (warning Cain)
- God's protection (marking Cain)
- God's provision (Seth granted)
- Worship beginning (calling on the LORD)

The chapter ends not with Lamech's boast but with people calling on God's name. The line of the serpent has its cities and songs. But the line of the woman has something better: access to the living God.

And from that line of worshipers will come the One who will finally crush the serpent's head—not with seventy-sevenfold vengeance, but with seventy-sevenfold forgiveness poured out from a cross.
