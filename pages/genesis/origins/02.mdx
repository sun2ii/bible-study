# Genesis 2: Eden

> Genesis 1 shows God as cosmic Sovereign, creating by command from a distance. Genesis 2 zooms in and shows God as intimate Father—forming with His hands, breathing into nostrils, planting a garden, walking in the cool of the day. This is not a different God; it's a closer look. The same One who spoke galaxies into existence kneels in the dirt to shape you. Creation's goal isn't work—it's rest, relationship, and home.

        │           │
        │           └─► Rest from COMPLETION
        │               Rest as ENJOYMENT
        │               Rest as PRESENCE
        │
        └─► Why does God rest?
            │
            ├─ Not because He's weary
            ├─ But because He's FINISHED
            │

                        Work → Rest → Presence → Enjoyment
```

```
THE BLESSING (v. 3)
    │
    └─► "Then God BLESSED the seventh day and made it HOLY,
         because on it he rested from all the work of creating"
        │
        ├─ בָּרַךְ (barak) — "blessed"
        │   └─► God blessed DAY 5 creatures
        │       God blessed DAY 6 humanity
        │       God blessed DAY 7 itself
        │       │
        │       └─► A day can be BLESSED

            └─► First thing called HOLY in Scripture
                │
                ├─ Not a place
                ├─ Not a person
                └─► A TIME
                    │
                    └─► Holiness enters creation through RHYTHM
                        Before there's a temple, there's Sabbath
                        Before there's a priest, there's rest
                        │
                        └─► The seventh day is the first sanctuary
```

**The Sabbath Pattern:**

| Day | Activity | Evaluation |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1-6 | Creating | "Good" / "Very good" |
| 7 | Resting | "Blessed" and "Holy" |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I work to rest, or rest to work? Is my rhythm creation-shaped or culture-shaped?*

**One-line:** God completes creation and rests—not from exhaustion but from accomplishment, blessing time itself with holiness.

|---------|--------|---------|

                    Temple faces East (awaiting return)

                └─► Tree of KNOWLEDGE of GOOD and EVIL
                    │
                    ├─ "Knowledge of good and evil" =

                    │
                    └─► The test:
                        Will you let GOD define good/evil?
                        Or will you seize that role yourself?
```

                        Where God dwells with man
                        Where life flows to the world
```

**Eden as Temple:**

| Eden Feature | Temple Parallel |
|--------------|-----------------|
| God walks there (3:8) | God's presence in Holy of Holies |
| River flows out | Ezekiel's temple river (Ezek 47) |
| Gold, onyx, resin (v. 12) | Temple decorations (Exod 25) |
| Cherubim guard it (3:24) | Cherubim guard Ark |
| Man "works and keeps" | Priests serve and guard |

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see God as Gardener—preparing good things before I arrive, delighting to give?*

**One-line:** God plants a garden of delight, with rivers of life flowing out to bless the world—Eden as the first temple.

### 4. Vocation and Command (vv. 15-17)

**Key Hebrew:**
- עָבַד (avad) — "work, serve"
- שָׁמַר (shamar) — "keep, guard, watch"
- מוֹת תָּמוּת (mot tamut) — "surely die" (dying you shall die)

```
THE PLACEMENT (v. 15)
    │
    └─► "The LORD God TOOK the man
         and PUT him in the Garden of Eden
         to WORK it and TAKE CARE OF it"
        │
        ├─ God PLACED him
        │   └─► Not random
        │       Not wandering
        │       Intentionally positioned
        │       │
        │       └─► You are where you are ON PURPOSE
        │
        ├─ עָבַד (avad) — "work, serve"
        │   │
        │   └─► Same word for:
        │       - Working the ground
        │       - Serving God (worship)
        │       - Priestly service
        │       │
        │       └─► Work IS worship
        │           Adam's gardening was service to God
        │           Tending creation is spiritual act
        │
        └─► שָׁמַר (shamar) — "keep, guard, watch over"
            │
            └─► Same word for:
                - Levites "guarding" tabernacle (Num 3:7-8)
                - Keeping/obeying commandments
                - Watchman guarding city
                │
                └─► Adam as PRIEST of Eden
                    Guard the sacred space
                    Keep out what shouldn't enter
                    │
                    └─► He will fail this (chapter 3)
                        The serpent enters
                        Adam doesn't guard
```

```
THE FREEDOM (v. 16)
    │
    └─► "You are FREE to eat from ANY TREE in the garden"
        │
        ├─ אָכֹל תֹּאכֵל (akol tokel)
        │   └─► "Eating you shall eat"
        │       Hebrew intensive: "FREELY eat"
        │       Abundant permission
        │
        └─► Count the trees:
            │
            ├─ "All kinds of trees" (v. 9)
            │   Probably THOUSANDS
            │
            └─► Forbidden: ONE
                │
                └─► The ratio of freedom to restriction:
                    │
                    ├─ 999 trees: YES
                    └─ 1 tree: NO
                        │
                        └─► God is GENEROUS
                            The restriction is MINIMAL
                            The freedom is VAST
                            │
                            └─► Yet the serpent will focus
                                entirely on the ONE (3:1)
```

```
THE PROHIBITION (v. 17)
    │
    └─► "But you MUST NOT eat from
         the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
         for when you eat from it
         you will CERTAINLY DIE"
        │
        ├─ "Must not" = clear boundary
        │   └─► Love requires LIMITS
        │       Relationship requires TRUST
        │       Freedom requires BOUNDARIES
        │       │
        │       └─► This isn't arbitrary
        │           It's protective
        │           It's formative
        │
        └─► מוֹת תָּמוּת (mot tamut) — "dying you shall die"
            │
            ├─ Hebrew intensive: certainty
            │   "You will SURELY die"
            │
            └─► What kind of death?
                │
                ├─ SPIRITUAL: Immediate (ch. 3—hiding, shame)
                ├─ RELATIONAL: Immediate (ch. 3—blame, exile)
                └─ PHYSICAL: Eventual (ch. 5—"and he died")
                    │
                    └─► All three happen
                        Death enters in layers
                        Separation from God, others, life itself
```

**The Structure of Freedom:**

```
FREEDOM WITH LIMITS
    │
    ├─ BROAD PERMISSION: "Any tree"
    │   └─► Abundance
    │       Generosity
    │       Delight
    │
    └─► SINGLE PROHIBITION: "Except one"
        │
        └─► This is the shape of LOVE:
            │
            ├─ Trust requires choice
            │   (No choice = no trust)
            │
            ├─ Love requires freedom
            │   (Forced love isn't love)
            │
            └─► The tree exists so Adam CAN choose
                │
                └─► Without the possibility of NO
                    There's no meaning to YES
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I focus on God's vast generosity or fixate on His few boundaries?*

**One-line:** God gives man vocation (work and guard) and one command with vast freedom—the single limit makes love possible.

### 5. Not Good to Be Alone (vv. 18-20)

**Key Hebrew:**
- לֹא־טוֹב (lo-tov) — "not good"
- עֵזֶר (ezer) — "helper"
- כְּנֶגְדּוֹ (kenegdo) — "suitable for him, corresponding to him"

```
THE FIRST "NOT GOOD" (v. 18)
    │
    └─► "The LORD God said,
         'It is NOT GOOD for the man to be ALONE'"
        │
        ├─ לֹא־טוֹב (lo-tov) — "not good"
        │   │
        │   └─► FIRST negative evaluation in creation
        │       │
        │       ├─ Six times: "It was good"
        │       ├─ Once: "Very good"
        │       └─► Now: "NOT good"
        │           │
        │           └─► Something in creation is INCOMPLETE
        │               Not sinful—INCOMPLETE
        │               │
        │               └─► Solitude is not the design
        │                   Isolation is not the goal
        │                   We are made for RELATIONSHIP
        │
        └─► לְבַדּוֹ (levado) — "alone, by himself"
            │
            └─► Man has:
                ├─ Purpose (work the garden)
                ├─ Place (Eden)
                ├─ Provision (all trees)
                ├─ Presence of God
                │
                └─► But still "NOT GOOD"
                    │
                    └─► Something is missing
                        Not sin
                        Not rebellion
                        Just... incomplete
                        │
                        └─► God DESIGNED us for human community
                            Not just vertical (God)
                            But horizontal (each other)
```

```
THE SOLUTION ANNOUNCED (v. 18b)
    │
    └─► "I will make a HELPER SUITABLE for him"
        │
        ├─ עֵזֶר (ezer) — "helper"
        │   │
        │   └─► This word is NOT inferior
        │       │
        │       ├─ Used of GOD 16x in OT:
        │       │   "God is my HELPER" (Psalm 33:20)
        │       │   "My HELP comes from the LORD" (Psalm 121:2)
        │       │
        │       └─► Helper = STRENGTH, not servitude
        │           The one who comes to RESCUE
        │           The one who provides what's LACKING
        │           │
        │           └─► Eve is not Adam's assistant
        │               She's his DELIVERER from incompleteness
        │
        └─► כְּנֶגְדּוֹ (kenegdo) — "corresponding to him"
            │
            ├─ נֶגֶד (neged) — "opposite, in front of"
            │
            └─► "A helper AS HIS OPPOSITE"
                "A helper FACING HIM"
                "A helper CORRESPONDING TO HIM"
                │
                └─► NOT: Identical (that would be clone)
                    NOT: Inferior (that would be servant)
                    IS: COUNTERPART
                    │
                    └─► Equal in dignity
                        Different in design
                        Complementary in function
                        │
                        └─► Like a mirror image:
                            Same value, different orientation
```

```
THE PARADE (vv. 19-20)
    │
    └─► "The LORD God had formed out of the ground
         all the wild animals and all the birds...
         He brought them to the man to see
         what he would NAME them"
        │
        ├─ God brings animals to Adam
        │   └─► Like a father presenting options
        │       "Is this what you need?"
        │       God already knows the answer
        │       But Adam must DISCOVER it
        │
        ├─ NAMING = exercising dominion
        │   └─► Adam fulfills his role (1:26, 28)
        │       He evaluates, categorizes, names
        │       He is functioning as ruler
        │
        └─► "But for Adam no suitable helper was found"
            │
            └─► After every animal:
                │
                └─► NOT THIS
                    Not the dog
                    Not the lion
                    Not the eagle
                    │
                    └─► None CORRESPOND to him
                        None FACE him as equal
                        None can COMPLETE him
                        │
                        └─► Why this parade?
                            │
                            └─► So Adam would KNOW his need
                                So he would FEEL the ache
                                So when woman comes,
                                he'd recognize: "THIS ONE!"
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I try to fill with animals/work/things what only human community can fill?*

**One-line:** God declares human solitude "not good"—man needs a helper-counterpart, and no animal will do.

        │       - Saul's camp was defenseless (1 Sam 26:12)
        │       │
        │       └─► Divine-induced sleep
        │           Not natural drowsiness
        │           God-given unconsciousness
        │
        └─► Why sleep?
            │
            ├─ Adam doesn't EARN her
            ├─ Adam doesn't MAKE her
            ├─ Adam doesn't even WATCH
            │
            └─► She is PURE GIFT
                │
                └─► He wakes and she's THERE
                    Not his work—God's gift
                    Not his achievement—grace
```

```
THE TAKING (v. 21b)
    │
    └─► "He took one of the man's RIBS
         and then closed up the place with flesh"

        │       - Hillside (2 Sam 16:13)
        │       │
        │       └─► Could mean: "one of his SIDES"
        │           Not just a bone—a SIDE of him
        │           Half of him goes into her
        │
        └─► Why from his side?
            │
            ├─ Not from his HEAD (to rule over him)
            ├─ Not from his FEET (to be beneath him)
            └─► From his SIDE
                │
                └─► Equal position
                    Near his heart
                    Under his arm (protection)
                    │
                    └─► She is part OF him
                        Not separate creation
                        Same substance
```

```
THE BUILDING (v. 22)
    │
    └─► "Then the LORD God MADE a woman
         from the rib he had taken out of the man,
         and he BROUGHT HER to the man"
        │
        ├─ בָּנָה (banah) — "BUILT"
        │   │
        │   └─► Not "formed" (יָצַר/yatsar) like Adam
        │       BUILT — architectural term
        │       │
        │       └─► Woman is CONSTRUCTED
        │           Carefully designed
        │           Deliberately crafted
        │           │
        │           └─► Same word for building temple

                    God officiates
                    God gives her away
                    │
                    └─► Marriage is GOD'S idea
                        Not human invention
                        Not cultural construct
                        DIVINE institution
```

```
THE RECOGNITION (v. 23)
    │
    └─► "The man said:
         'This is now BONE OF MY BONES
          and FLESH OF MY FLESH;

        └─► Wordplay: אִשָּׁה (ishah) from אִישׁ (ish)
            │
            └─► "Woman" (ishah) from "Man" (ish)
                Like: "She" from "He"
                Like: "Her" from "Him"
                │
                └─► Linguistically linked
                    Distinct but derived
                    Different but same source
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I see my spouse (or future spouse) as God's gift—not my achievement but pure grace?*

**One-line:** God builds woman from man's side and presents her as gift—Adam erupts in poetry: "At last! Bone of my bone!"

### 7. Marriage Instituted (vv. 24-25)

**Key Hebrew:**
- דָּבַק (davaq) — "cling, hold fast, be united"
- בָּשָׂר אֶחָד (basar echad) — "one flesh"
- עֲרוּמִּים (arummim) — "naked"
- בּוֹשׁ (bosh) — "ashamed"

```
THE PATTERN (v. 24)
    │
    └─► "That is why a man LEAVES his father and mother
         and is UNITED to his wife,
         and they become ONE FLESH"
        │
        ├─ "That is why" — עַל־כֵּן (al-ken)

        │       Explaining the ORDER from Eden
        │       This is how it's SUPPOSED to work
        │
        ├─ עָזַב (azav) — "leave, forsake"
        │   │

        │       ├─ Not abandoning parents

        │           └─► Before marriage: Parents are primary
        │               After marriage: Spouse is primary
        │               │
        │               └─► Many marriages fail HERE
        │                   Never properly LEFT
        │                   Divided loyalty
        │
        ├─ דָּבַק (davaq) — "cling, hold fast, be united"
        │   │
        │   └─► Strong word:
        │       - Ruth "clung" to Naomi (Ruth 1:14)
        │       - Israel told to "cling" to God (Deut 10:20)

        │           PERMANENT BONDING
        │           Covenant commitment
        │
        └─► בָּשָׂר אֶחָד (basar echad) — "ONE FLESH"
            │
            ├─ Sexual union (obviously)
            │
            └─► But MORE than sexual:

                └─► Two persons becoming ONE unit
                    │
                    └─► Not erasing individuality
                        FUSING purpose

                            You're ripping ONE into two
                            (Malachi 2:16, Matt 19:6)
```

```
THE THREE MOVEMENTS OF MARRIAGE
    │
    ├─ 1. LEAVE (עָזַב / azav)
    │      └─► Public separation from origin family
    │          New primary loyalty established
    │
    ├─ 2. CLEAVE (דָּבַק / davaq)
    │      └─► Permanent bonding to spouse
    │          Covenant commitment
    │
    └─ 3. BECOME (בָּשָׂר אֶחָד / basar echad)
           └─► One flesh union
               Not just sex—one LIFE
```

```
THE INNOCENCE (v. 25)
    │
    └─► "Adam and his wife were both NAKED,
         and they felt NO SHAME"
        │
        ├─ עֲרוּמִּים (arummim) — "naked"
        │   │
        │   └─► Completely exposed
        │       Nothing hidden
        │       Full vulnerability
        │
        └─► לֹא יִתְבּשָׁשׁוּ (lo yitboshashu) — "not ashamed"
            │
            └─► No shame. No hiding. No covering.
                │
                └─► What does this mean?
                    │
                    ├─ PHYSICALLY: No clothes needed
                    │   Bodies were not shameful
                    │   Sexuality was pure
                    │
                    ├─ EMOTIONALLY: No fear of rejection
                    │   Fully known, fully loved
                    │   Nothing to hide
                    │
                    └─ SPIRITUALLY: No guilt
                        No sin to cover
                        No separation from God
                        │
                        └─► This is EDEN:
                            Complete transparency
                            Complete safety
                            Complete intimacy
                            │
                            └─► Chapter 3 will DESTROY this
                                First thing after sin:
                                "They knew they were naked" (3:7)
                                Shame enters
                                Hiding begins
```

**Before and After the Fall:**

| Before (2:25) | After (3:7) |
|---------------|-------------|
| Naked | Knew they were naked |
| No shame | Covered themselves |
| Fully exposed | Hiding from each other |
| Transparent before God | Hiding from God |

**Diagnostic:** *Where am I hiding? What would it take to be fully known and unashamed?*

**One-line:** Marriage is instituted—leave, cleave, become one flesh—and in innocence, they are naked without shame.

## Unified Framework

```
GENESIS 2: REST, RELATIONSHIP, HOME
    │
    ├─ SABBATH (vv. 1-3)
    │   └─► Goal of creation: REST
    │       Not productivity but PRESENCE
    │       First holy thing: TIME
    │
    ├─ FORMATION (vv. 4-7)
    │   └─► Man formed intimately
    │       Dust + Breath = Living being
    │       We are EARTHY and GOD-BREATHED
    │
    ├─ GARDEN (vv. 8-14)
    │   └─► Place prepared: EDEN (delight)
    │       Trees for beauty and food
    │       Rivers flow OUT to bless world
    │       Eden as first TEMPLE
    │
    ├─ VOCATION (vv. 15-17)
    │   └─► Purpose given: WORK and GUARD
    │       Work is worship
    │       Freedom vast, restriction minimal
    │       Death as consequence of disobedience
    │
    ├─ LONELINESS (vv. 18-20)
    │   └─► "NOT GOOD" to be alone
    │       Animals paraded—none suitable
    │       Man needs COUNTERPART
    │
    └─ WOMAN (vv. 21-25)
        └─► Built from his SIDE
            Brought as GIFT
            "Bone of my bone!"
            LEAVE → CLEAVE → ONE FLESH
            Naked, no shame
```

---

## Diagnostic Summary

| Section | Core Question |
|---------|---------------|
| Sabbath | Do I work to rest, or treat rest as weakness? |
| Formation | Do I live aware of being dust AND God-breathed? |
| Garden | Do I see God as generous Gardener preparing good things? |
| Vocation | Do I focus on God's vast YES or fixate on His few NOs? |
| Not Good Alone | Am I trying to fill with things what only people can fill? |
| Woman | Do I see marriage as gift, not achievement? |
| Marriage | Am I leaving, cleaving, becoming one? Or divided? |
| Nakedness | Where am I hiding that I could be known and unashamed? |

---

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Genesis 2:** God rests from completed creation, forms man intimately from dust and breath, plants a garden of delight, gives vocation with one limit, declares solitude "not good," builds woman from man's side, and institutes marriage—leave, cleave, one flesh, naked and unashamed.

## Personal Notes

### The Intimate God

Chapter 1 shows God creating by WORD—powerful, sovereign, distant.
Chapter 2 shows God creating by HANDS—intimate, personal, close.

```
THE TWO PORTRAITS
    │
    ├─ Chapter 1: God as KING
    │   └─► "Let there be..."
    │       Speaks from throne
    │       Creation obeys
    │
    └─► Chapter 2: God as FATHER
        │
        ├─ FORMS with hands (v. 7)
        ├─ BREATHES into nostrils (v. 7)
        ├─ PLANTS a garden (v. 8)
        ├─ WALKS in the cool of day (3:8)
        ├─ BRINGS animals to Adam (v. 19)
        ├─ CAUSES sleep (v. 21)
        ├─ BUILDS woman (v. 22)
        └─ BRINGS her to man (v. 22)
            │
            └─► This is a HANDS-ON God
                Not distant deity
                INTIMATE Father
```

This is the God I'm getting to know. Not just the cosmic Creator, but the One who kneels in the dirt to form me, who breathes His own breath into my lungs, who prepares good things before I arrive, who brings gifts while I sleep.

### Dust and Breath

v. 7 grounds me.

```
WHAT I AM
    │
    ├─ DUST: I am not God
    │   └─► Mortal
    │       Limited
    │       Will return to ground
    │       │
    │       └─► This is HUMILITY
    │           (Humus = ground)
    │           I am not the center
    │
    └─► BREATH: I am not mere animal
        └─► God-breathed
            Image-bearing
            Eternal capacity
            │
            └─► This is DIGNITY
                I matter infinitely
                I'm not accident
```

Both are true. I'm dust—but DIGNIFIED dust. I'm mortal—but MEANINGFUL.

The world offers two lies:
1. "You're nothing" (shame)
2. "You're everything" (pride)

Genesis 2 says: "You're dust breathed on by God." Neither nothing nor everything—but BELOVED creature.

### Eden as Home

God prepared BEFORE He placed.

```
THE ORDER
    │
    ├─ Garden planted (v. 8)
    ├─ Trees grown (v. 9)
    ├─ Rivers flowing (v. 10)
    │
    └─► THEN man placed (v. 15)
        │
        └─► God doesn't throw you into wilderness
            He prepares HOME first
            │
            └─► John 14:2: "I go to prepare a place for you"
                Same pattern
                Same Father
```

When I feel unprepared for life, I remember: He prepared the garden before He put Adam in it. He prepares places before He puts me in them.

### The One Tree

vv. 16-17 wreck the serpent's narrative before it starts.

```
GOD'S ACTUAL WORDS (2:16-17)
    │
    ├─ "You are FREE to eat"
    ├─ "From ANY tree"
    ├─ "...except ONE"
    │
    └─► 99.9% YES
        0.1% NO

SERPENT'S SPIN (3:1)
    │
    └─► "Did God really say, 'You must not eat
         from ANY tree in the garden'?"
        │
        └─► 0% YES
            100% NO
            │
            └─► Total inversion
                Generous God → Stingy God
                Vast freedom → Total restriction
```

I do this. Focus on what I CAN'T have. Forget the thousand gifts. Resent the one boundary.

**Application:** Make a list of what God HAS given. Dwarf the one thing you're fixating on.

### "Not Good" Alone

v. 18 surprises me.

```
WHAT ADAM HAD
    │
    ├─ Purpose (work the garden)
    ├─ Place (Eden)
    ├─ Provision (all trees)
    ├─ Presence of God (walked with him)
    │
    └─► Still: "NOT GOOD"
        │
        └─► Having God isn't enough?
            │
            └─► God DESIGNED us for EACH OTHER
                Not just vertical (God)
                But horizontal (humans)
                │
                └─► This isn't weakness
                    This is DESIGN
                    │
                    └─► "The LORD God said..."
                        GOD diagnosed this
                        Not Adam complaining
                        God SEES the incompleteness
```

I need people. Not because I'm broken—because I'm DESIGNED this way.

### Ezer Kenegdo

v. 18's "helper suitable" (עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ) is often misunderstood.

```
WHAT "HELPER" (EZER) MEANS
    │
    ├─ Used of GOD 16 times:
    │   "My HELP comes from the LORD" (Ps 121:2)
    │   "God is our HELP and shield" (Ps 33:20)
    │
    └─► If "helper" means inferior,
        Then God is inferior to us
        │
        └─► Obviously not
            │
            └─► EZER = Strength coming to aid
                The one who RESCUES
                The one who provides what's LACKING
                │
                └─► Eve DELIVERS Adam from incompleteness
                    Not his servant—his RESCUER
```

```
WHAT "SUITABLE" (KENEGDO) MEANS
    │
    ├─ נֶגֶד (neged) = "opposite, facing"
    │
    └─► "Corresponding to him"
        "Facing him as equal"
        "His counterpart"
        │
        └─► NOT: Same (clone)
            NOT: Lesser (servant)
            IS: COMPLEMENTARY EQUAL
                │
                └─► Like puzzle pieces
                    Different shapes
                    Perfect fit
                    Equal value
```

### Naked and Unashamed

v. 25 haunts me.

```
EDEN'S INTIMACY
    │
    └─► Naked. No shame.
        │
        ├─ Nothing hidden
        ├─ Nothing covered
        ├─ Nothing feared
        │
        └─► This is what we LOST
            │
            └─► Now we hide:
                ├─ From each other (image management)
                ├─ From ourselves (denial)
                └─ From God (religion as cover)
                    │
                    └─► The gospel offers RETURN:
                        │
                        └─► "Nothing can separate us
                             from the love of God" (Rom 8)
                            │
                            └─► Fully known
                                Fully loved
                                No condemnation
                                │
                                └─► This is where
                                    the story is GOING
                                    (Rev 21-22)
```

---

### Summary

Genesis 2 is about HOME.

- God rests—creation is home for His presence
- Man is formed—given life from God's breath
- Garden planted—home prepared before arrival
- Vocation given—purposeful life in the home
- Woman built—companion for the home
- Marriage instituted—new home established

And before sin enters, we see what home SHOULD BE:
- Naked without shame
- Known without fear
- Together without competition
- With God without hiding

Chapter 3 will wreck this.

But the rest of the Bible is God's plan to get us HOME again.

**Revelation 21:3:** "God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them."

Back to the garden. Back to home. Back to Father.
