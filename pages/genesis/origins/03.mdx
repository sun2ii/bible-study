# Genesis 3: The Fall

> Genesis 1-2 showed creation at its peak: "very good," naked without shame, walking with God in the cool of the day. Genesis 3 shatters everything. A serpent questions God's word, a woman is deceived, a man stands silent, and humanity falls. Yet even in judgment, mercy whispers—a promise of One who will crush the serpent's head. This chapter explains why the world is broken and hints at how it will be healed.

## Section Analysis

### 1. The Serpent's Strategy (vv. 1-5)

**Key Hebrew:**
- עָרוּם (arum) — "crafty, shrewd"
- הָנָּחָשׁ (hannachash) — "the serpent"
- אַף כִּי (aph ki) — "Did God really...?" (questioning particle)

```
THE SERPENT'S INTRODUCTION (v. 1a)
    │
    └─► "Now the SERPENT was more CRAFTY
         than any of the wild animals
         the LORD God had made"
        │
        ├─ עָרוּם (arum) — "crafty, shrewd"
        │   │
        │   └─► SAME ROOT as עֲרוּמִּים (arummim) — "naked" (2:25)
        │       │
        │       └─► WORDPLAY:
        │           2:25: They were NAKED (arummim), no shame
        │           3:1: Serpent was CRAFTY (arum)
        │           │
        │           └─► The naked innocents
        │               meet the shrewd deceiver
        │
        ├─ נָחָשׁ (nachash) — "serpent"
        │   │
        │   └─► Later identified as Satan:
        │       Rev 12:9: "that ancient serpent
        │                  called the devil, or Satan"
        │       Rev 20:2: "He seized the dragon,
        │                  that ancient serpent"
        │
        └─► "The LORD God had MADE"
            │
            └─► The serpent is a CREATURE
                Under God's authority
                Not an equal power
                │
                └─► Even Satan is made by God
                    A created being, not eternal
```

```
THE FIRST QUESTION (v. 1b)
    │
    └─► "He said to the woman,
         'Did God really say, "You must not eat
          from ANY tree in the garden"?'"
        │
        ├─ אַף כִּי (aph ki) — "Did God really...?"
        │   │
        │   └─► Not a sincere question
        │       An insinuation
        │       "Can that REALLY be right?"
        │       │
        │       └─► Doubt planted as a question
        │           Not directly attacking
        │           QUESTIONING
        │
        ├─ WHAT GOD ACTUALLY SAID (2:16-17):
        │   └─► "You are FREE to eat from ANY tree..."
        │       "But you must NOT eat from ONE tree..."
        │       │
        │       └─► 99.9% YES, 0.1% NO
        │
        └─► WHAT THE SERPENT IMPLIES:
            │
            └─► "You must not eat from ANY tree"
                │
                └─► 0% YES, 100% NO
                    │
                    └─► Total inversion
                        │
                        ├─ God's generosity → God's stinginess
                        ├─ Vast freedom → Total restriction
                        └─ Loving Father → Withholding tyrant
```

```
THE WOMAN'S RESPONSE (vv. 2-3)
    │
    └─► "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,
         but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit
         from the tree that is in the middle of the garden,
         and you must NOT TOUCH IT, or you will die'"
        │
        ├─ She CORRECTS the serpent
        │   └─► "We may eat from the trees"
        │       Not total restriction
        │
        ├─ But she also ADDS to God's word:
        │   └─► "and you must not TOUCH it"
        │       │
        │       └─► God never said this (cf. 2:17)
        │           │
        │           └─► Why add to God's word?
        │               │
        │               ├─ Option 1: Adam added it
        │               │   Building a "fence" around the law
        │               │
        │               ├─ Option 2: She exaggerated
        │               │   Making God seem stricter
        │               │
        │               └─► Either way: God's word is now DISTORTED
        │                   Either too strict or too loose
        │                   Truth has slipped
        │
        └─► She also SOFTENS the warning:
            │
            └─► God said: "You will CERTAINLY die"
                         (מוֹת תָּמוּת — dying you will die)
                │
                She said: "or you will die"
                │
                └─► Certainty → mere possibility
                    The penalty seems less serious
```

```
THE SERPENT'S DENIAL (v. 4)
    │
    └─► "You will NOT certainly die"
        │
        ├─ לֹא מוֹת תְּמֻתוּן (lo mot temutun)
        │   └─► "Not—dying you will die"
        │       Direct contradiction of God
        │       │
        │       └─► First LIE in Scripture
        │           Calling God a liar
        │
        └─► The serpent's strategy:
            │
            ├─ Step 1: Question God's word (v. 1)
            │          "Did God really say...?"
            │
            └─ Step 2: Deny God's word (v. 4)
                       "You will NOT die"
                       │
                       └─► From doubt to denial
                           The progression of deception
```

```
THE SERPENT'S PROMISE (v. 5)
    │
    └─► "For God KNOWS that when you eat from it
         your eyes will be OPENED,
         and you will be LIKE GOD,
         knowing good and evil"
        │
        ├─ "God KNOWS"
        │   └─► Accusation: God is HIDING something
        │       He's not protecting you
        │       He's WITHHOLDING from you
        │       │
        │       └─► The generous God of chapter 2
        │           is now cast as stingy and suspicious
        │
        ├─ "Your eyes will be OPENED"
        │   │
        │   └─► Half-truth:
        │       │
        │       ├─ TRUE: Their eyes WILL be opened (v. 7)
        │       └─► LIE: What they'll see is their NAKEDNESS
        │                Not divine glory—SHAME
        │
        └─► "You will be LIKE GOD"
            │
            └─► כֵּאלֹהִים (ke'elohim) — "like God/gods"
                │
                ├─ The original temptation:
                │   BE YOUR OWN GOD
                │   Define good and evil for yourself
                │   No need to trust and obey
                │
                └─► Irony: They were ALREADY like God
                    Made in His IMAGE (1:26-27)
                    │
                    └─► The serpent offers
                        what they already have
                        at the cost of everything
```

**The Anatomy of Temptation:**

| Stage | Serpent's Move | What It Targets |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Question** | "Did God really say...?" | Trust in God's word |
| **Distort** | "ANY tree" (total restriction) | View of God's character |
| **Deny** | "You will NOT die" | Fear of consequences |
| **Promise** | "You will be like God" | Desire for autonomy |

**Diagnostic:** *Where is the enemy questioning God's word in my life? Where am I adding to or subtracting from what He said?*

**One-line:** The serpent questions, distorts, and denies God's word, promising godlikeness in exchange for disobedience.

### 2. The Fall (vv. 6-7)

**Key Hebrew:**
- תַּאֲוָה (ta'avah) — "desire, craving"
- נֶחְמָד (nechmad) — "desirable, pleasant"
- וַתִּפָּקַחְנָה (watippaqachnah) — "and they were opened" (eyes)

```
THE SEEING (v. 6a)
    │
    └─► "When the woman SAW that the fruit of the tree was
         GOOD FOR FOOD and
         PLEASING TO THE EYE and
         DESIRABLE FOR GAINING WISDOM"
        │
        ├─ Three appeals:
        │   │
        │   ├─ "Good for FOOD" — physical appetite
        │   │   └─► The body's desire
        │   │
        │   ├─ "Pleasing to the EYE" — aesthetic desire
        │   │   └─► The eyes' desire
        │   │
        │   └─► "Desirable for WISDOM" — intellectual desire
        │       └─► The mind's desire
        │
        └─► Compare 1 John 2:16:
            │
            ├─ "The lust of the FLESH"
            │   (good for food)
            │
            ├─ "The lust of the EYES"
            │   (pleasing to the eye)
            │
            └─► "The PRIDE of life"
                (desirable for wisdom)
                │
                └─► Same pattern of temptation
                    Body, eyes, pride
                    │
                    └─► Also: Jesus' temptation (Matt 4)
                        Bread (body), kingdoms (eyes),
                        prove yourself (pride)
```

```
THE TAKING (v. 6b)
    │
    └─► "She TOOK some and ATE it.
         She also GAVE some to her husband,
         who was WITH HER,
         and he ATE it"
        │
        ├─ The progression:
        │   │
        │   ├─ SAW
        │   ├─ DESIRED
        │   ├─ TOOK
        │   ├─ ATE
        │   └─► GAVE
        │       │
        │       └─► James 1:14-15:
        │           "Each person is tempted
        │            when they are dragged away
        │            by their own evil DESIRE...
        │            After DESIRE has conceived,
        │            it gives birth to SIN"
        │
        ├─ "Who was WITH HER"
        │   │
        │   └─► עִמָּהּ (immah) — "with her"
        │       │
        │       └─► WHERE WAS ADAM?
        │           │
        │           ├─ Right there. Silent.
        │           │
        │           ├─ He was supposed to GUARD (שָׁמַר)
        │           │   the garden (2:15)
        │           │   He let the serpent in
        │           │
        │           └─► He was supposed to SPEAK
        │               God's word
        │               He stayed silent
        │               │
        │               └─► Eve was deceived
        │                   Adam was not (1 Tim 2:14)
        │                   He CHOSE, eyes open
        │
        └─► "And he ATE"
            │
            └─► The federal head falls
                │
                └─► Romans 5:12:
                    "Sin entered the world through ONE MAN"
                    │
                    └─► Eve sinned first
                        But Adam bears the weight
                        He was the covenant head
```

```
THE OPENING (v. 7)
    │
    └─► "Then the EYES of both of them were OPENED,
         and they REALIZED they were NAKED"
        │
        ├─ "Eyes were opened"
        │   │
        │   └─► The serpent was RIGHT about this
        │       But horribly WRONG about what they'd see
        │       │
        │       ├─ Promised: Divine knowledge
        │       └─► Received: Shame
        │           │
        │           └─► Half-truths are whole lies
        │
        ├─ "They realized they were NAKED"
        │   │
        │   └─► עֵירֻמִּם (erummim) — "naked"
        │       │
        │       └─► 2:25: "Naked and NOT ASHAMED"
        │           3:7: "Naked and REALIZED IT"
        │           │
        │           └─► What changed?
        │               │
        │               ├─ NOT their bodies
        │               ├─ Their RELATIONSHIP with God
        │               │
        │               └─► Sin brings EXPOSURE
        │                   What was innocent is now shameful
        │                   What was open is now hidden
        │
        └─► "So they SEWED fig leaves together
             and made COVERINGS for themselves"
            │
            └─► FIRST HUMAN EFFORT after sin:
                │
                ├─ Self-covering
                │   Hiding shame with their own work
                │
                └─► Fig leaves won't last
                    (God will replace them—v. 21)
                    │
                    └─► Every religion since:
                        Humans trying to cover
                        what only God can clothe
```

**The Pattern of Sin:**

```
SIN'S PROGRESSION
    │
    ├─ 1. SEEING: External attraction
    │      "She SAW..."
    │
    ├─ 2. DESIRING: Internal longing
    │      "...it was DESIRABLE..."
    │
    ├─ 3. TAKING: Willful action
    │      "She TOOK..."
    │
    ├─ 4. CONSUMING: Personal indulgence
    │      "...and ATE"
    │
    └─ 5. SHARING: Spreading corruption
           "She GAVE..."
           │
           └─► Sin never stays private
               It multiplies
               It involves others
```

**Diagnostic:** *What am I "seeing" that is leading me to desire, take, and consume what God has forbidden?*

**One-line:** Eve sees, desires, takes, and eats—Adam stands silent—their eyes open to shame, and they cover themselves.

### 3. Hiding from God (vv. 8-10)

**Key Hebrew:**
- לְרוּחַ הַיּוֹם (leruach hayyom) — "in the cool of the day" (lit. "in the wind/spirit of the day")
- וַיִּתְחַבֵּא (wayyitchabbe) — "and he hid himself"
- יָרֵא (yare) — "afraid"

THE SOUND OF GOD (v. 8)
    │
    └─► "Then the man and his wife heard the SOUND
         of the LORD God as he was WALKING in the garden
         in the COOL of the day"
        │
        ├─ קוֹל (qol) — "sound, voice"
        │   └─► The sound of God APPROACHING
        │       Once welcome—now terrifying
        │
        ├─ מִתְהַלֵּךְ (mithallekh) — "walking about"
        │   │
        │   └─► Same word used for:
        │       - God "walking" among Israel (Lev 26:12)
        │       - Promise in 2 Cor 6:16
        │       │
        │       └─► God is not distant
        │           He WALKS with His people
        │           He is PRESENT
        │           │
        │           └─► But now presence is THREAT
        │               Not comfort
        │
        └─► לְרוּחַ הַיּוֹם (leruach hayyom)
            │
            ├─ Traditionally: "cool of the day"
            │   (Evening breeze)
            │
            └─► Possibly: "wind/spirit of the day"
                │
                └─► The Spirit that hovered (1:2)
                    Now comes in judgment

THE HIDING (v. 8b)
    │
    └─► "And they HID from the LORD God
         among the trees of the garden"
        │
        ├─ וַיִּתְחַבֵּא (wayyitchabbe) — "hid himself"

        │   └─► FIRST HIDING in Scripture
        │       │
        │       └─► Before sin: Naked, no shame, no hiding

        │
        ├─ "From the LORD God"
        │   │
        │   └─► The ONE they cannot escape
        │       Psalm 139:7-8:
        │       "Where can I go from your Spirit?
        │        Where can I flee from your presence?"
        │       │
        │       └─► You cannot hide from God
        │           But sin makes you TRY
        │
        └─► "Among the TREES of the garden"
            │
            └─► Ironic:
                │
                ├─ Trees were for FOOD and BEAUTY (2:9)
                ├─ One tree was forbidden
                ├─ Now trees are for HIDING
                │
                └─► Creation used against Creator
                    Gifts used to avoid the Giver
```

```
THE QUESTION (v. 9)
    │
    └─► "But the LORD God CALLED to the man,
         'WHERE ARE YOU?'"
        │
        ├─ God CALLS
        │   │
        │   └─► He doesn't abandon
        │       He doesn't wait for them to come out
        │       He PURSUES
        │       │
        │       └─► This is GRACE

        │           God comes LOOKING for sinners
        │
        └─► אַיֶּכָּה (ayyekkah) — "Where are you?"
            │
            └─► NOT because God doesn't know
                │
                ├─ God knows EVERYTHING
                │
                └─► The question is FOR ADAM:
                    │
                    ├─ "Do YOU know where you are?"
                    ├─ "Do you see what has happened?"
                    ├─ "Do you understand your condition?"
                    │
                    └─► God gives opportunity:
                        CONFESSION before accusation
                        │
                        └─► The question every sinner must answer:
                            "Where AM I in relation to God?"
```

```
THE CONFESSION (v. 10)
    │
    └─► "He answered, 'I heard you in the garden,
         and I was AFRAID because I was NAKED;
         so I HID'"
        │
        ├─ "I was AFRAID"
        │   │
        │   └─► יָרֵאתִי (yareti) — "I feared"
        │       │
        │       └─► FIRST FEAR in Scripture
        │           │
        │           ├─ Before sin: No fear
        │           │   Perfect love, perfect fellowship
        │           │
        │           └─► After sin: FEAR of God
        │               Not reverent awe (good fear)
        │               TERROR (bad fear)
        │               │
        │               └─► 1 John 4:18:
        │                   "Perfect love drives out fear...
        │                    fear has to do with PUNISHMENT"
        │
        ├─ "Because I was NAKED"
        │   │
        │   └─► Partial truth, avoiding the real issue
        │       │
        │       └─► He's naked because of what he DID
        │           But he only mentions the symptom
        │           Not the cause
        │
        └─► "So I HID"
            │
            └─► The new pattern:
                │
                ├─ SIN leads to SHAME
                ├─ SHAME leads to FEAR

**Before and After:**

| Before the Fall | After the Fall |
|-----------------|----------------|
| God walks with them | They hide from God |
| Naked, no shame | Naked, ashamed |
| Fellowship | Fear |
| Openness | Hiding |
| Trust | Terror |

**Diagnostic:** *Where am I hiding from God? What fear is driving me to conceal rather than confess?*

**One-line:** Adam and Eve hear God walking in the garden, hide in fear, and when God calls, Adam confesses fear and shame.

### 4. The Interrogation (vv. 11-13)

**Key Hebrew:**
- מִי הִגִּיד (mi higgid) — "who told you?"
- נָתַתָּה (natattah) — "you gave" (accusation toward God)
- הִשִּׁיאַנִי (hishi'ani) — "deceived me"

```
THE FIRST QUESTION (v. 11)
    │
    └─► "And he said, 'WHO told you that you were naked?
         Have you EATEN from the tree
         that I commanded you not to eat from?'"
        │
        ├─ "WHO told you?"
        │   │
        │   └─► Two questions expose the situation:
        │       │
        │       ├─ Question 1: Source of knowledge
        │       │   "Who told you that you were naked?"
        │       │   How do you KNOW you're naked?
        │       │
        │       └─► Question 2: Direct inquiry
        │           "Have you eaten from the tree?"
        │           Did you DO what I forbade?
        │
        └─► God moves from symptom to cause
            │
            └─► Adam talked about NAKEDNESS (v. 10)
                God asks about the TREE (v. 11)
                │
                └─► God knows the real issue
                    We often avoid it
```

```
ADAM'S RESPONSE (v. 12)
    │
    └─► "The man said, 'The WOMAN you put here WITH ME—
         SHE gave me some fruit from the tree,
         and I ate it'"
        │
        ├─ "The WOMAN"
        │   │
        │   └─► Blame shift #1: to Eve
        │       │
        │       └─► She DID give him the fruit (v. 6)
        │           But she didn't FORCE him
        │           He was "with her"—silent, passive
        │           He CHOSE to eat
        │
        ├─ "YOU put here with me"
        │   │
        │   └─► Blame shift #2: to GOD
        │       │
        │       └─► Subtle accusation:
        │           "If YOU hadn't given me this woman..."
        │           │
        │           └─► The gift is now blamed
        │               The Giver is implicated
        │               │
        │               └─► 2:23: "Bone of my bone!"
        │                   3:12: "The woman YOU gave me"
        │                   │
        │                   └─► From celebration to accusation
        │                       Joy becomes blame
        │
        └─► "And I ate it"
            │
            └─► Finally: the admission
                Tacked on at the end
                After blame is distributed
                │
                └─► This is how we confess:
                    "Yes, BUT..."
                    "I did it, BUT here's why
                     it's not really my fault..."
```

```
EVE'S RESPONSE (v. 13)
    │
    └─► "Then the LORD God said to the woman,
         'What is this you have done?'
         The woman said, 'The SERPENT DECEIVED me,
         and I ate'"
        │
        ├─ God's question: "What is this you have done?"
        │   │
        │   └─► Not "Why did you do this?"
        │       "WHAT IS THIS?"
        │       │
        │       └─► Horror. Grief.
        │           "What have you DONE?"
        │           │
        │           └─► God knows the answer
        │               The question exposes the gravity
        │
        ├─ "The SERPENT deceived me"
        │   │
        │   └─► הִשִּׁיאַנִי (hishi'ani) — "deceived/beguiled me"
        │       │
        │       └─► This is TRUE
        │           The serpent DID deceive her (1 Tim 2:14)
        │           │
        │           └─► But it's still DEFLECTION
        │               Explanation, not excuse
        │               │
        │               └─► Being deceived doesn't remove
        │                   responsibility
        │                   It explains HOW, not WHY
        │
        └─► "And I ate"
            │
            └─► Like Adam: admission at the end
                After the explanation
```

```
THE PATTERN OF BLAME
    │
    ├─ ADAM:
    │   └─► Blames EVE → Blames GOD → admits "I ate"
    │       Woman → God → (finally) self
    │
    ├─ EVE:
    │   └─► Blames SERPENT → admits "I ate"
    │       Serpent → (finally) self
    │
    └─► SERPENT:
        └─► Not interrogated
            No opportunity to explain
            Simply JUDGED (v. 14)
            │
            └─► There is no excuse for the devil
                No mitigating circumstances
                Pure, calculated evil
```

**The Blame Chain:**

```
ADAM
  ↓ blames
EVE ("the woman you put here with me")
  ↓ blames
SERPENT ("the serpent deceived me")
  ↓
(Serpent has no one to blame—receives only judgment)
```

**Diagnostic:** *When confronted with my sin, do I confess or deflect? Whom do I blame?*

**One-line:** God interrogates—Adam blames Eve and God, Eve blames the serpent—confession comes only after deflection.

---

### 5. Judgment on the Serpent (vv. 14-15)

**Key Hebrew:**
- אָרוּר (arur) — "cursed"
- אֵיבָה (evah) — "enmity, hostility"
- זֶרַע (zera) — "seed, offspring"
- שׁוּף (shuph) — "crush, strike"

```
THE CURSE (v. 14)
    │
    └─► "So the LORD God said to the serpent,
         'Because you have done this,
         CURSED are you above all livestock
         and all wild animals!
         You will crawl on your belly
         and you will eat dust
         all the days of your life'"
        │
        ├─ NO INTERROGATION
        │   │
        │   └─► God asked Adam: "Have you eaten...?"
        │       God asked Eve: "What is this...?"
        │       God tells serpent: "Because you have done this..."
        │       │
        │       └─► No opportunity to explain
        │           No question of motive
        │           Pure JUDGMENT
        │           │
        │           └─► The serpent is not deceived
        │               He IS the deceiver
        │               No excuse possible
        │
        ├─ אָרוּר (arur) — "CURSED"
        │   │
        │   └─► FIRST CURSE in Scripture
        │       │
        │       └─► Directed at the serpent
        │           (Not at Adam or Eve directly—
        │            though the ground is cursed, v. 17)
        │
        ├─ "Above all livestock and wild animals"
        │   │
        │   └─► The serpent was "more crafty"
        │       than any beast (v. 1)
        │       Now "more CURSED" than any beast
        │       │
        │       └─► Exaltation in craftiness
        │           becomes degradation in curse
        │
        └─► "Crawl on your belly... eat dust"
            │
            ├─ Symbol of utter humiliation
            │   Face in the dirt
            │   Lower than low
            │
            └─► "All the days of your life"
                │
                └─► Permanent condition
                    No restoration
                    No redemption for the serpent
```

```
THE PROMISE (v. 15)
    │
    └─► "And I will put ENMITY
         between you and the woman,
         and between YOUR OFFSPRING and HERS;
         HE will CRUSH your head,
         and you will STRIKE his heel"
        │
        ├─ אֵיבָה (evah) — "enmity, hostility"
        │   │
        │   └─► GOD puts the enmity
        │       │
        │       └─► This is GRACE:
        │           │
        │           ├─ The woman ALLIED with the serpent (v. 6)
        │           ├─ God BREAKS that alliance
        │           └─► Enmity is a GIFT
        │               │
        │               └─► Without it, humanity would
        │                   remain in league with evil
        │                   │
        │                   └─► Conflict with Satan = mercy

        │       ├─ SERPENT'S seed: Those aligned with Satan
        │       │   (Cain, Pharaoh, Herod, etc.)
        │       │
        │       └─► WOMAN'S seed: Those aligned with God
        │           Leading to ONE ultimate Seed
        │           │
        │           └─► Galatians 3:16:

**The Two Seeds:**

| Serpent's Seed | Woman's Seed |
|----------------|--------------|
| Cain (4:1-8) | Abel, Seth (4:25) |
| Pharaoh | Moses |
| Herod | Jesus |
| Antichrist | Christ |
| All who reject God | All who trust God |

**Diagnostic:** *Am I living as seed of the woman (in enmity with evil) or at peace with the serpent?*

**One-line:** The serpent is cursed to crawl in dust, and God promises a coming "He" who will crush the serpent's head.

### 6. Judgment on the Woman (v. 16)

**Key Hebrew:**
- עֶצֶב (etsev) — "pain, toil, sorrow"
- תְּשׁוּקָה (teshuqah) — "desire, longing"
- מָשַׁל (mashal) — "rule"

```
THE JUDGMENT (v. 16)
    │
    └─► "To the woman he said,
         'I will make your PAINS in CHILDBEARING very severe;
         with PAINFUL LABOR you will give birth to children.
         Your DESIRE will be for your husband,
         and he will RULE over you'"
        │
        ├─ "I will MAKE" — הַרְבָּה אַרְבֶּה (harbah arbeh)
        │   └─► "Multiplying I will multiply"
        │       Hebrew intensive: greatly increase
        │
        ├─ PART 1: Pain in childbearing
        │   │
        │   ├─ עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ (itstsevonek) — "your pain/toil"
        │   │   │
        │   │   └─► עֶצֶב (etsev) — same word used for ADAM (v. 17)
        │   │       "Painful toil"
        │   │       │
        │   │       └─► Both experience ETSEV:
        │   │           Woman in BEARING life
        │   │           Man in SUSTAINING life
        │   │
        │   └─► "With PAINFUL LABOR you will give birth"
        │       │
        │       └─► Childbirth is now marked by PAIN
        │           The source of new life
        │           comes through suffering
        │           │
        │           └─► Not: "You cannot have children"
        │               IS: "Childbearing is now painful"
        │               │
        │               └─► The blessing continues (be fruitful)
        │                   But now through suffering
        │
        └─► PART 2: Relational conflict
            │
            └─► "Your DESIRE will be for your husband,
                 and he will RULE over you"
                │
                ├─ תְּשׁוּקָה (teshuqah) — "desire"
                │   │
                │   └─► Same word in 4:7:
                │       "Sin is crouching at your door;
                │        it DESIRES to have you (תְּשׁוּקָה)"
                │       │
                │       └─► Not romantic desire
                │           CONTROLLING desire
                │           Desire to DOMINATE
                │
                ├─ Two interpretations:
                │   │
                │   ├─ Traditional: Sexual/emotional desire
                │   │   Woman will long for husband
                │   │   But he will dominate her
                │   │
                │   └─► Parallel to 4:7 (more likely):
                │       │
                │       └─► "Desire" = desire to CONTROL
                │           "Rule" = dominating response
                │           │
                │           └─► The beautiful complementarity
                │               of chapter 2 is now
                │               a POWER STRUGGLE
                │               │
                │               ├─ She desires to control
                │               └─ He dominates in response
                │                   │
                │                   └─► This is NOT God's design
                │                       This is the CURSE
                │                       The RESULT of sin
                │
                └─► What was GIVEN (headship, 2:24)
                    becomes DISTORTED (domination)
                    │
                    └─► Ephesians 5:21-33 REDEEMS this:
                        │
                        ├─ Mutual submission
                        ├─ Sacrificial love
                        └─► Christ and church as model
```

**Before and After:**

| Before the Fall (Gen 2) | After the Fall (Gen 3) |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| "Bone of my bone" — unity | Power struggle — conflict |
| Helper corresponding | Desire to control |
| One flesh | Competition |
| Naked, no shame | Hiding, blaming |
| Complementary | Combative |

**Diagnostic:** *Where do I see the curse's power struggle in my relationships? Am I seeking to dominate or serve?*

**One-line:** The woman receives pain in childbirth and relational conflict—the beautiful partnership becomes a power struggle.

### 7. Judgment on Adam (vv. 17-19)

**Key Hebrew:**
- עֶצֶב (etsev) — "painful toil" (same as v. 16)
- בְּזֵעַת אַפֶּיךָ (beze'at appekha) — "by the sweat of your brow"
- עָפָר (aphar) — "dust"

```
THE REASON (v. 17a)
    │
    └─► "To Adam he said, 'Because you LISTENED to your wife
         and ATE fruit from the tree about which I commanded you,
         "You must not eat from it"'"
        │
        ├─ "Because you LISTENED to your wife"
        │   │
        │   └─► NOT: Listening to wife is sin
        │       │
        │       └─► IS: Listening to wife OVER God
        │           │
        │           ├─ God commanded: Don't eat
        │           ├─ Wife offered: Eat
        │           └─► Adam chose wife's voice over God's voice
        │               │
        │               └─► The problem is not WHO he listened to
        │                   But WHAT he did in response
        │                   │
        │                   └─► He followed her into sin
        │                       Instead of leading her out
        │
        └─► "About which I COMMANDED you"
            │
            └─► צִוִּיתִיךָ (tsiwwitiykha) — "I commanded you"
                │
                └─► The command was to ADAM (2:16-17)
                    Before Eve was created
                    He was responsible to TEACH and GUARD
                    │
                    └─► He failed on both counts
```

```
THE GROUND CURSED (v. 17b-18)
    │
    └─► "CURSED is the GROUND because of you;
         through PAINFUL TOIL you will eat food from it
         all the days of your life.
         It will produce THORNS and THISTLES for you,
         and you will eat the plants of the field"
        │
        ├─ "Cursed is the GROUND"
        │   │
        │   └─► אֲרוּרָה הָאֲדָמָה (arurah ha'adamah)
        │       │
        │       ├─ Adam from ADAMAH (ground)
        │       │   Wordplay: Human from humus
        │       │
        │       └─► The curse is on the GROUND, not Adam directly
        │           But Adam experiences it:
        │           │
        │           └─► The ground resists him
        │               Work that was JOY (2:15)
        │               becomes TOIL (3:17)
        │
        ├─ עִצָּבוֹן (itstsavon) — "painful toil"
        │   │
        │   └─► Same root as woman's pain (עֶצֶב/etsev)
        │       │
        │       └─► Woman: etsev in BEARING life
        │           Man: etsev in SUSTAINING life
        │           │
        │           └─► Both share in the suffering
        │               Different arenas, same root pain
        │
        └─► "THORNS and THISTLES"
            │
            └─► קוֹץ וְדַרְדַּר (qots wedardar)
                │
                ├─ Not present in Eden
                │   Result of the curse
                │
                ├─ Jesus wore a crown of THORNS (Matt 27:29)
                │   │
                │   └─► Taking the curse upon Himself
                │       The thorns of Genesis 3
                │       on the brow of Christ
                │
                └─► The ground that was PARTNER (2:15)
                    is now ADVERSARY (3:18)
```

```
DEATH SENTENCE (v. 19)
    │
    └─► "By the SWEAT of your brow
         you will eat your food
         until you RETURN to the GROUND,
         since FROM it you were taken;
         for DUST you are
         and to DUST you will return"
        │
        ├─ "Sweat of your brow"
        │   │
        │   └─► בְּזֵעַת אַפֶּיךָ (beze'at appekha)
        │       │
        │       └─► Work is now EXHAUSTING
        │           Not just purposeful activity
        │           But weary labor
        │
        ├─ "Until you RETURN to the ground"
        │   │
        │   └─► Here is the DEATH sentence
        │       │
        │       ├─ God said: "You will certainly DIE" (2:17)
        │       │
        │       └─► The serpent said: "You will NOT die" (3:4)
        │           │
        │           └─► WHO TOLD THE TRUTH?
        │               │
        │               └─► God did.
        │                   "To dust you will return"
        │                   DEATH is now certain
        │
        ├─ "From it you were TAKEN"
        │   │
        │   └─► 2:7: "Formed from the dust of the ground"
        │       3:19: "To dust you will return"
        │       │
        │       └─► The circle closes
        │           Dust → Life → Dust
        │           │
        │           └─► Without redemption:
        │               This is humanity's fate
        │
        └─► "DUST you are, to DUST you will return"
            │
            ├─ עָפָר (aphar) — "dust"
            │
            └─► The great equalizer:
                │
                ├─ Rich and poor → dust
                ├─ Powerful and weak → dust
                ├─ All humanity → dust
                │
                └─► Ecclesiastes 3:20:
                    "All go to the same place;
                     all come from dust,
                     and to dust all return"
                    │
                    └─► Without resurrection:
                        This is the end
                        │
                        └─► BUT: Easter changes everything
                            "Dust you are" is not FINAL
                            Christ rose—and we will too
```

**The Curse Pattern:**

| Relationship | Before | After |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Human → Ground | Work it, keep it (joy) | Painful toil (curse) |
| Ground → Human | Produces food freely | Produces thorns, resistance |
| Human → Death | Tree of life available | Death inevitable |

**Diagnostic:** *How do I experience the curse in my work? Do I find hope beyond "dust to dust"?*

**One-line:** Adam's ground is cursed with thorns and toil, and death is pronounced: dust to dust.

        │                           LIFE will come through woman

**The Two Coverings:**

| Human Covering (v. 7) | Divine Covering (v. 21) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Fig leaves | Garments of skin |
| Self-made | God-made |
| Temporary | Lasting |
| Inadequate | Adequate |
| Works | Grace |
| No death required | Death required |

**Diagnostic:** *Am I still wearing fig leaves—my own efforts to cover shame—or have I received God's covering?*

**One-line:** Adam names Eve "life" in faith, and God clothes them with skins—first death, first sacrifice, first grace.

**The Way Back:**

```
THE PATH TO THE TREE OF LIFE
    │
    ├─ BLOCKED in Genesis 3:24
    │   └─► Cherubim + flaming sword
    │       No access for sinful humanity
    │
    ├─ PICTURED in the Tabernacle/Temple
    │   └─► Cherubim on the curtain
    │       Cherubim on the Ark
    │       The way to God's presence
    │       Through sacrifice
    │
    ├─ OPENED at the Cross
    │   └─► Matthew 27:51:
    │       "The curtain of the temple was torn in two"
    │       │
    │       └─► The way is OPEN
    │           Through Christ's blood
    │
    └─► RESTORED in New Creation
        └─► Revelation 22:2:
            "On each side of the river stood
             the TREE OF LIFE"
            │
            └─► Access restored
                "Blessed are those who wash their robes,
                 that they may have the right
                 to the tree of life" (Rev 22:14)
```

**Diagnostic:** *Do I live as an exile longing for home, or have I forgotten there's a garden to return to?*

**One-line:** God expels humanity from Eden, stationing cherubim to guard the tree of life—exile until redemption.

## Unified Framework

```
GENESIS 3: THE FALL AND THE PROMISE
    │
    ├─ TEMPTATION (vv. 1-5)
    │   └─► Serpent questions, distorts, denies God's word
    │       Promises godlikeness through disobedience
    │
    ├─ FALL (vv. 6-7)
    │   └─► Eve sees, desires, takes, eats
    │       Adam (with her) eats
    │       Eyes opened—to SHAME
    │       Fig leaves sewn
    │
    ├─ CONFRONTATION (vv. 8-13)
    │   └─► God walks, they HIDE
    │       "Where are you?"
    │       Fear, nakedness, hiding
    │       Blame: Adam → Eve → Serpent
    │
    ├─ JUDGMENT (vv. 14-19)
    │   ├─► Serpent: Cursed, crushed (but not yet)
    │   │   └─► PROMISE: Her seed will crush your head
    │   │
    │   ├─► Woman: Pain in childbearing
    │   │   Relational conflict
    │   │
    │   └─► Man: Ground cursed, toil, thorns
    │       Death: Dust to dust
    │
    └─ GRACE IN EXILE (vv. 20-24)
        └─► Eve named "Life" (faith!)
            God clothes them (first sacrifice)
            Expelled from Eden
            Cherubim guard the way
            │
            └─► BUT: The way will be OPENED
                Through the woman's Seed
                Who will crush the serpent's head
                And restore access to the tree of life

## Chapter in One Sentence

**Genesis 3:** The serpent deceives Eve into eating the forbidden fruit, Adam follows in silence, their eyes open to shame, God confronts their hiding and blame, curses the serpent with future defeat, pronounces pain and toil on humanity, yet clothes them with skins and promises a coming Seed who will crush evil—then exiles them from Eden with cherubim guarding the way to life.

## Personal Notes

### The Strategy of Evil

vv. 1-5 reveal how temptation works. The serpent doesn't start with "Disobey God!" He starts with a question.

```
THE SERPENT'S METHOD
    │
    ├─ Step 1: QUESTION ("Did God really say...?")
    │   └─► Plant doubt, not denial
    │       Make God's word seem UNCERTAIN
    │
    ├─ Step 2: DISTORT ("from ANY tree")
    │   └─► Make God seem STINGY
    │       Focus on restriction, forget freedom
    │
    ├─ Step 3: DENY ("You will NOT die")
    │   └─► Contradict God directly
    │       Once doubt is planted, denial follows
    │
    └─ Step 4: PROMISE ("You'll be like God")
        └─► Offer an upgrade
            Autonomy instead of trust
            Self-rule instead of submission
```

This is still how it works. The enemy rarely says "Reject God outright." He says "Did God really mean...?" He whispers doubt before demanding rebellion.

**Application:** When I hear "Did God really say...?" in my mind—about His word, His character, His commands—I know who's talking.

### The Silence of Adam

v. 6 haunts me: "who was WITH HER."

```
WHERE WAS ADAM?
    │
    └─► Right there.
        │
        ├─ He heard the serpent
        ├─ He watched the dialogue
        ├─ He said NOTHING
        │
        └─► Then he ATE
            │
            └─► His sin was not deception
                (1 Tim 2:14: "Adam was not deceived")
                │
                └─► His sin was PASSIVITY
                    Then PARTICIPATION
                    │
                    └─► He was supposed to:
                        ├─ GUARD the garden (2:15)
                        │   He let the serpent in
                        │
                        ├─ TEACH God's word
                        │   He stayed silent
                        │
                        └─► LEAD his wife
                            He followed her into sin
```

Adam's failure wasn't ignorance. It was abdication. He knew better. He watched. He was silent. Then he joined.

**Application:** Where am I being silent when I should speak? Where am I passive when I should protect?

### The First Gospel

v. 15 is the hinge of the Bible. In the middle of curse comes PROMISE.

```
THE PROTOEVANGELIUM (v. 15)
    │
    └─► "HE will crush your head,
         you will strike his heel"
        │
        ├─ A "HE" is coming
        │   Singular, masculine
        │   One specific descendant
        │
        ├─ Born of WOMAN
        │   "Her seed" (unusual phrase)
        │   Men have seed in Hebrew thought
        │   This One comes from woman
        │   └─► Virgin birth?
        │
        ├─ Will CRUSH the serpent
        │   HEAD = fatal blow
        │   Victory over evil
        │
        └─► Will be WOUNDED in the process
            HEEL = painful but not fatal
            Suffering but not defeat
            │
            └─► THE CROSS:
                │
                ├─ Satan struck Christ's heel
                │   Real suffering
                │   Real death
                │   Real pain
                │
                └─► Christ crushed Satan's head
                    Real victory
                    Death defeated
                    Evil overthrown
```

From Genesis 3 onward, the Bible is tracking this promise. Every genealogy asks: Is THIS the one? Every king raises hope: Will HE crush the serpent? Every prophet points forward: He is COMING.

Until Galatians 4:4: "When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman."

**The Seed has come. The head is crushed. The story ends in victory.**

### Grace Before Exile

vv. 20-21 break me. After all the judgment, before the exile:

```
GRACE NOTES
    │
    ├─ Adam names Eve "LIFE"
    │   └─► After hearing "dust to dust"
    │       He names her HOPE
    │       │
    │       └─► This is FAITH
    │           Believing the promise (v. 15)
    │           Despite the judgment (vv. 16-19)
    │
    └─► God CLOTHES them
        │
        ├─ They made fig leaves
        │   Inadequate
        │   Self-effort
        │
        └─► God makes skin garments
            │
            ├─ Adequate covering
            ├─ Requires DEATH
            │
            └─► First sacrifice
                First blood
                First substitution
                │
                └─► Pointing to THE sacrifice
                    THE blood
                    THE Lamb
```

Even in judgment, God clothes. Even in exile, God provides. Even in curse, there's promise.

### Exile and Hope

v. 24 is devastating. Cherubim and a flaming sword. No way back.

```
THE CLOSED DOOR
    │
    └─► Tree of life: GUARDED
        Eden: LOST
        Access: BLOCKED
        │
        └─► This is where humanity lives:
            East of Eden
            Exiles from home
            Cut off from life
```

But the story doesn't end here. The cherubim reappear—on the Ark, in the Temple—always guarding the way to God's presence. And then:

```
THE OPENED WAY
    │
    ├─ Matthew 27:51
    │   "The curtain was torn in two"
    │   │
    │   └─► The way is OPEN
    │       Through Christ's death
    │
    └─► Revelation 22:2
        "The tree of life"
        │
        └─► Access RESTORED
            For all who come through the Lamb
```

The sword that guards is the cross that opens. The way blocked is the way restored. Genesis 3 poses the problem; Revelation 22 provides the answer.

We are exiles. But we're exiles with a ticket home.

---

### Summary

Genesis 3 is the chapter that explains everything wrong with the world. Why suffering? Sin entered. Why death? Curse pronounced. Why conflict? Relationship broken. Why toil? Ground cursed.

But Genesis 3 is also the chapter that launches everything right with God's plan. In the very moment of judgment:

- God promises victory (v. 15)
- God provides covering (v. 21)
- God preserves life (blocking the tree was mercy)

The serpent wins a battle. But the war is already lost. His head will be crushed. The woman's Seed will triumph. The exile will end.

**Revelation 22:3:** "No longer will there be any curse."

What Genesis 3 broke, Revelation 22 restores. What Adam lost, Christ regains. The tree of life will be accessible again.

And the story moves from Garden lost to Garden restored—through the cross that turns curse into blessing.
